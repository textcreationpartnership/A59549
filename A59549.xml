            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>WHOSOEVER underſtandeth any thing of the State of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, as it hath now been for ſome Ages in the World, will be eaſily convinced, that there is no one Point of our Religion more neceſſary to be daily <hi>Preached,</hi> to be earneſtly <hi>preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed</hi> and inſiſted on, than that of <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> here recommended by the Apoſtle.</p>
               <p>It hath fared (as the Learned Mr. <hi>Hales</hi> obſerved) with the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion in
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:63712:7"/>this matter, as it did with the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> of old. The <hi>great</hi> and <hi>principal</hi> Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which God gave the <hi>Jews,</hi> and which (as they themſelves teach) was the <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> of all their <hi>Law,</hi> was, to <hi>worſhip</hi> the <hi>God</hi> of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Him</hi> only to <hi>ſerve:</hi> yet ſuch was the Perverſneſs of that People, that <hi>This</hi> was the Commandment, that of all others, they could never be brought to Keep; but they were continually run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning into <hi>Idolatry,</hi> notwithſtanding all the Methods that God made uſe of to reclaim them from that Sin. What the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of <hi>one God</hi> was to the <hi>Jews;</hi> that <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity,</hi> is to the Chriſtians, even the <hi>Great</hi> diſtinguiſhing <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Character</hi> of their <hi>Profeſſion.</hi> And yet, to the ſhame of Chriſtians it may be ſpoken, there is no one Commandment in all Chriſt's Religion, that has been ſo <hi>generally</hi> and ſo <hi>ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſly</hi> violated among his Followers, as this. Witneſs the many bitter <hi>Fewds</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions</hi> that have ſo long Embroiled <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom;</hi> and the numerous <hi>Sects,</hi> and <hi>Parties,</hi> and <hi>Communions,</hi> into which at this day it ſtands divided.</p>
               <p>And God knows, this is a thing that cannot be ſufficiently lamented among our ſelves: For though in many Reſpects we are the <hi>Happiest</hi> Nation in the World; and particularly in this, that we have the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of all others, both as to the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution</hi>
                  <pb n="3" facs="tcp:63712:7"/>of our <hi>Church,</hi> and the <hi>Purity</hi> of Chriſt's <hi>Doctrine,</hi> profeſſed therein: Yet in this point of <hi>Schiſms,</hi> and <hi>Diviſions,</hi> and <hi>Religious Quarrels,</hi> we are as <hi>unhappy,</hi> if not more, than any.</p>
               <p>Whether ever we ſhall ſee that bleſſed Day, when theſe our <hi>Breaches</hi> will be heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and that an End being put to our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable <hi>Separations,</hi> and the Unchriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>Animoſities</hi> they are the Occaſion of, we ſhall all join together in one <hi>Communion,</hi> and <hi>with one mind, and one mouth, glorifie God,</hi> (as the Apoſtle expreſſes it) God only knows. But ſure I am, it is the Duty of every one of us, heartily to <hi>Pray</hi> for it; and not only ſo, but in our Place and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to contribute all we can towards it. It was this Conſideration that put me upon the Choice of theſe Words of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> for my Argument at this time. <hi>Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore follow after the things that make for Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In treating of which, I ſhall endeavour <hi>Two</hi> things. <hi>First,</hi> To Explain the <hi>Duty</hi> here recommended, by reducing it to its Particular <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Inſtances. Secondly,</hi> To ſet before you the great <hi>Obligations</hi> that lie upon us to the Practice of it.</p>
               <p>As to the firſt of theſe things, <hi>viz.</hi> what is contained or implied in this Duty of <hi>Following after the things that make for Peace;</hi> you may be pleaſed to take notice, That this <hi>Duty</hi> hath a <hi>twofold</hi> Object, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:63712:8"/>to the <hi>two</hi> different <hi>Relations</hi> and <hi>Capacities</hi> in which we are to be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; namely, the <hi>Church</hi> our Common <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,</hi> and <hi>Particular</hi> Chriſtians our <hi>Brethren.</hi> In the <hi>first</hi> Relation, we are conſidered as <hi>Subjects,</hi> in the other as <hi>Fellow Chriſtians.</hi> Now with reſpect to the <hi>former,</hi> the <hi>Peace</hi> we are to purſue implies <hi>Obedience,</hi> and the <hi>Preſervation</hi> of <hi>Communion,</hi> in oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Separation.</hi> With reſpect to the latter, it implies mutual <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>Quarrels</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions.</hi> So that you ſee, my Buſineſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this <hi>first</hi> Head muſt be, to ſhew what are the Particulars of our Duty, or what are the <hi>Things that make for Peace,</hi> in both theſe Reſpects.</p>
               <p>I begin with what is due from us to the <hi>Church</hi> in order to <hi>Peace,</hi> as <hi>Peace</hi> ſtands in Contradiſtinction to <hi>Schiſm.</hi> And this Point I ſhall beg leave to diſcuſs, very plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and particularly; becauſe I fear many of us have wrong <hi>Notions</hi> about it: And yet it is a matter of ſuch Conſequence, that the right underſtanding of it would go a great way to the <hi>Cure</hi> of the ſad <hi>Diviſions</hi> that are among us.</p>
               <p>What I have to ſay upon this Point, I ſhall comprize in the <hi>four</hi> following Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions; taking my Riſe from the <hi>first</hi> Principle of <hi>Church-Society.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="5" facs="tcp:63712:8"/>
               <p>The firſt Propoſition I lay down is this, <hi>That every</hi> Chriſtian <hi>is, by vertue of his Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, a</hi> Member <hi>of the</hi> Church <hi>of</hi> Chriſt, <hi>and is bound to join in</hi> External Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>with it, where it can be had.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For the clearing of this, let it be taken notice of, That the <hi>Method</hi> which our Saviour ſet on foot for our <hi>Salvation,</hi> doth not ſo much conſider us as <hi>ſingle Perſons,</hi> as joined together in <hi>one common Society.</hi> It was his Deſign, to gather to Himſelf a <hi>Church</hi> out of Mankind, to erect and form a <hi>Body Politick,</hi> of which Himſelf ſhould be the <hi>Head,</hi> and Particular Chriſtians the <hi>Members;</hi> and in this <hi>Method</hi> through <hi>Obedience</hi> to his <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Government,</hi> to bring Men to Salvation.</p>
               <p>This is variouſly ſet forth to us in the New Teſtament.<note place="margin">Joh. 15.1.</note> Sometimes <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> are repreſented under the Notion of a <hi>Vine;</hi> of which He is the <hi>Root,</hi> and They are the <hi>Branches.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.</note> Sometimes under the Notion of a <hi>Natural Body,</hi> of which <hi>Chriſt</hi> is the <hi>Head,</hi> and all <hi>Believers</hi> the <hi>Members.</hi> And accordingly what ever Chriſt is ſaid to have <hi>done,</hi> or <hi>ſuffered</hi> for Mankind, he is ſaid to have done or ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for them, not as <hi>Scattered Individuals,</hi> but as <hi>Incorporated</hi> into a <hi>Church.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 5.25.</note> Thus <hi>Chriſt loved the Church and gave himſelf for it.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Acts 20.28.</note> 
                  <hi>Chriſt redeemed the Church with his own Blood. Chriſt is the Saviour of his Body,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 5.23.</note> that
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:63712:9"/>is to ſay the <hi>Church;</hi> with many paſſages of the like Importance The plain Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence from hence is, that every Perſon, ſo far as he is a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> ſo far he is a <hi>Member</hi> of the <hi>Church.</hi> And agreeably here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, it is very plain that <hi>Baptiſm</hi> which is by all acknowledged, to be the <hi>Rite</hi> of <hi>Initiating</hi> us into <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> is in Scripture declared to be the <hi>Rite</hi> whereby we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred and admitted into the <hi>Church.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 12.13.</note> Thus St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſly tells us, that <hi>by one Spirit we are all Baptized into one Body.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now then it being thus evident, that every Chriſtian as a <hi>Christian,</hi> is a Member of that <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt</hi> which we call the <hi>Church;</hi> there will be little need of taking pains to prove, that every ſuch perſon is obliged to joyn in <hi>External Communion</hi> with the <hi>Church</hi> where he can do ſo: for the very nature of this <hi>Church-memberſhip</hi> doth imply it. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this, neither the <hi>Ends</hi> of <hi>Church-Society,</hi> nor the <hi>Benefits</hi> accruing to us there from, can be attained.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> not the <hi>Ends</hi> of it: The Ends of Church-Society are the more <hi>Solemn Worſhip</hi> of God, and the publick <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of our <hi>Religion,</hi> and the mutual <hi>Edification</hi> one of another: Now, how theſe can be in any mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure attained, without aſſociating together in <hi>publick Aſſemblies</hi> and <hi>mutual Offices,</hi> and other <hi>Acts</hi> of <hi>External Communion</hi> with one another, cannot any ways be imagined.</p>
               <pb n="7" facs="tcp:63712:9"/>
               <p>And as little in the <hi>Second</hi> place, can it be conceived how without this we can be made partakers of the Benefits and Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges that <hi>Chriſt</hi> hath made over to the <hi>Members</hi> of his <hi>Church.</hi> For we are to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider that God hath ſo ordered the matter, and without doubt for this very reaſon, to unite us the more firmly in <hi>Society,</hi> that the Privileges of the <hi>Goſpel,</hi> ſuch as Pardon of Sin, and the Grace of the Holy Spirit, are not ordinarily conveyed to us ſo immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by <hi>God,</hi> but that there muſt intervene the Miniſtery of <hi>Men.</hi> God's holy <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments</hi> are the Channels in which they are derived to us; and thoſe to whom he hath committed the Miniſtery of <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> and the <hi>Power</hi> of the <hi>Keys,</hi> are the <hi>Hands</hi> that muſt diſpenſe them. We have no promiſe of <hi>Spiritual Graces,</hi> but by theſe means: ſo that in order to the partaking of them, there is an abſolute neceſſity laid upon us of joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and communicating with the <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true indeed, God doth not ſo tie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up to theſe <hi>means,</hi> but that he can, and will in ſome caſes, confer the Benefits of them without them: as in caſe of a <hi>Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Apoſtaſie</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> or of <hi>Perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution</hi> for <hi>Religion;</hi> or of an unjuſt <hi>Excom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication,</hi> or any other caſe where Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with a <hi>true viſible Church</hi> is denied to us. But though <hi>God</hi> doth act <hi>extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narily</hi> in <hi>extraordinary</hi> caſes, where theſe
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:63712:10"/>
                  <hi>means</hi> cannot be had; yet this doth not at all diminiſh, much leſs take away the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of making uſe of them when they can be had.</p>
               <p>From what hath been diſcourſed on this <hi>firſt Propoſition,</hi> we may by the way, gather theſe two things: I only name them.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. How untrue their <hi>Poſition</hi> is that main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that all our Obligation to <hi>Church-Communion</hi> doth ariſe from a voluntary admiſſion of our ſelves into ſome particular <hi>Congregation,</hi> and an explicit Promiſe or Ingagement to joyn with it in <hi>Church-Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. How wildly and extravagantly they diſcourſe that talk of a <hi>Chriſtianity at large,</hi> without relation to a <hi>Church,</hi> or Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with any Society of <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond Propoſition</hi> is, <hi>That every one is bound to joyn in</hi> Communion <hi>with the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed</hi> National Church <hi>to which he belongs, ſuppoſing there be nothing in the</hi> Terms <hi>of its</hi> Communion <hi>that renders it unlawful for him ſo to do.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if we are bound to maintain Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> as I have before proved, it is plain, that we are bound to maintain Communion with that <hi>Part</hi> of it, within whoſe Verge the Divine Providence has caſt us. For we cannot communicate with the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> but by communicating with ſome <hi>Part</hi> of it<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
                  <pb n="9" facs="tcp:63712:10"/>and there is no communicating with any <hi>Part</hi> of it, but that under which we live, or where we have our Reſidence.</p>
               <p>Well, but it may be ſaid, that there may be ſeveral Diſtinct <hi>Churches</hi> in the place where we live. There may be the fixed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Aſſemblies of the <hi>National Church;</hi> and there may be ſeparate <hi>Congregations;</hi> both which are, or pretend to be <hi>Parts</hi> of the <hi>Catholick Church;</hi> ſo that it may be all one as to our communicating with <hi>that,</hi> which of theſe we joyn with, ſuppoſing we joyn but with one of them; and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently there is no neceſſity from that Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, that we ſhould hold Communion with the <hi>Publick Aſſemblies</hi> of the <hi>National Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But as to this, I deſire it may be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that That, which lays an Obligation upon us to joyn in Communion with the <hi>Church</hi> (to wit our being <hi>Members</hi> of that <hi>one Body of Chriſt</hi>) doth alſo lay an Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation upon us, as much as in us lies, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of <hi>that Body,</hi> (for this both the Fundamental <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Society,</hi> and the expreſs Precepts of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> do require of every <hi>Member:</hi>) But now to make a <hi>Rent</hi> in, or <hi>ſeparate</hi> from any <hi>Part</hi> of the <hi>Body</hi> of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> with which we may lawfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate (and ſuch we now ſuppoſe the <hi>eſtabliſhed Aſſemblies</hi> of the <hi>Nation</hi> to be) is directly contrary to the preſerving the
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:63712:11"/>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of <hi>that Body:</hi> And therefore certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſuch a <hi>Rent</hi> or <hi>Separation</hi> muſt be unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. And if ſo, then it muſt be unlawful alſo to joyn with any Congregation of Men among us that have made ſuch a <hi>Rent</hi> or <hi>Separation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that let our pretences be what they will, ſo long as the <hi>fixed Regular Aſſemblies</hi> of the <hi>Nation</hi> wherein we live, do truly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the <hi>Catholick Church,</hi> and we can lawfully joyn with them, it is certain, we are bound ſo to do, and not to joyn with thoſe <hi>Congregations</hi> that have withdrawn themſelves from them; for to do this, would be to joyn in <hi>Society</hi> with <hi>Separatiſts,</hi> would be a partaking of their Sin, and a breach of the <hi>Apoſtle</hi>'s Precept of <hi>avoiding thoſe that cauſe Diviſions.</hi> Rom. 16.17.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The third Popoſition</hi> is, <hi>That the being a</hi> Member <hi>of any</hi> Church, <hi>doth oblige a Man to ſubmit to all the</hi> Laws <hi>and</hi> Conſtitutions <hi>of that</hi> Church.</p>
               <p>This Propoſition is in the general ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable, that no <hi>ſober</hi> Man will deny it. And indeed, it is the <hi>Baſis</hi> upon which all <hi>Societies</hi> are founded, and by which they do ſubſiſt. For to ſuppoſe a <hi>Society,</hi> and yet to ſuppoſe the <hi>Members</hi> of it not under an Obligation to obey its <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> is to make Ropes of Sand, to ſuppoſe a <hi>Body</hi> without <hi>Sinews</hi> and <hi>Ligaments</hi> to hold its parts together.</p>
               <pb n="11" facs="tcp:63712:11"/>
               <p>So that all the Queſtion here, is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nature and extent of the <hi>Church</hi>'s Power over her <hi>Members,</hi> how far and in what inſtances ſhe hath <hi>Authority</hi> to oblige them. Which is a Queſtion not difficult to be anſwered, if Men would come to it without Paſſion and Prejudice.</p>
               <p>For it muſt be acknowledged in the <hi>firſt</hi> place, that the <hi>Church</hi> muſt, as all other <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties,</hi> be intruſted with, at leaſt ſo much <hi>power</hi> over her <hi>Subjects,</hi> as is neceſſary for the ſecuring her own <hi>Welfare</hi> and <hi>Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation:</hi> For to think otherwiſe, is to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>God</hi> to have founded a <hi>Church,</hi> and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the <hi>Well-being</hi> and <hi>Continuance</hi> of it; which are things that every one muſt grant; and yet to ſuppoſe that he hath denied her the uſe of the <hi>Means</hi> without which that <hi>Well-being</hi> and <hi>Continuance</hi> cannot be attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; which is monſtrous and contradictious.</p>
               <p>Farthermore it muſt be granted, that the <hi>Welfare</hi> and <hi>Preſervation</hi> of the <hi>Church</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſecured but upon theſe two Suppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Firſt,</hi> That Proviſion be made for the <hi>due</hi> and <hi>orderly</hi> performance of the <hi>Worſhip of God. Secondly,</hi> That there be means of maintaining <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong its <hi>Members.</hi> This latter is neceſſary to the <hi>Welfare</hi> and <hi>Preſervation</hi> of a <hi>Church</hi> as a <hi>Society,</hi> the former is neceſſary to it as a <hi>Religious Society.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="12" facs="tcp:63712:12"/>
               <p>Now then this being admitted, it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the general, that whatever <hi>Power</hi> over her <hi>Subjects</hi> is neceſſary in order to either of theſe things, all <hi>That</hi> at leaſt muſt be ſuppoſed to be lodged in the <hi>Church,</hi> that is to ſay, in <hi>Thoſe</hi> that have the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venment</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>So that from hence it is plain, in the <hi>firſt</hi> place, that the <hi>Church</hi> hath power ſo far to reſtrain the exerciſe of her <hi>Subjects Liberty,</hi> as to oblige them to all ſuch Laws, Rules, <hi>Orders,</hi> and <hi>Ceremonies</hi> as ſhe ſhall eſtabliſh for the more <hi>Solemn, Regular, Decent,</hi> and <hi>Convenient</hi> Adminiſtration of <hi>Religious Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</hi> And if it be queſtioned whether her <hi>Appointments</hi> do indeed conduce to that end, of <hi>That</hi> She her ſelf is to be the <hi>Judge;</hi> Her Members being no farther concerned there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in than only, before they obey her <hi>Impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> to ſee that they be not repugnant to the known <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> This Power the <hi>Church</hi> muſt be ſuppoſed to have, otherwiſe She will not be enabled to make Proviſion for the firſt thing whereon her <hi>Welfare</hi> doth depend, <hi>viz.</hi> the Performance of God's Worſhip and Service in a <hi>due</hi> and <hi>orderly</hi> manner.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> From hence alſo it is plain that the <hi>Church</hi> muſt be furniſhed with a Power to <hi>end</hi> and <hi>determine</hi> Controverſies of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> that ariſe among its <hi>Members:</hi> that is to ſay, to give ſuch an <hi>Authoritative</hi> deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:63712:12"/>of them, as that all <hi>Parties</hi> are bound to acquieſce in it: for without this ſhe would be defective in the <hi>ſecond</hi> thing required to her <hi>Welfare</hi> and <hi>Preſervation, viz.</hi> maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſelf in <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But here it may be taken notice, that this Power of <hi>ending Controverſies,</hi> which we aſcribe to the <hi>Church,</hi> doth not imply any <hi>Anthority</hi> over our <hi>Judgments;</hi> or that in virtue thereof ſhe can oblige us to give an <hi>inward aſſent</hi> to her <hi>Determinations,</hi> any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than ſhe gives us evidence for the <hi>Truth</hi> of them: (which is that extravagant Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> doth challenge to her ſelf) but only an <hi>Authority</hi> over our <hi>Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,</hi> that ſhe can oblige us to ſubmit ſo far to her <hi>Definitions,</hi> as not to <hi>act</hi> any thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to them. A Power in the <hi>former ſenſe</hi> is not neceſſary to the <hi>Church's Peace,</hi> and the reaſon is, becauſe our <hi>Judgments</hi> and <hi>Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> ſo long as we keep them to our ſelves, cannot poſſibly cauſe any diſturbance in, or do any injury to <hi>Society.</hi> But a Power in the <hi>latter ſenſe</hi> is abſolutely neceſſary; for if Men may be allowed to vent and publiſh whatever <hi>fancies</hi> come into their head, and the <hi>Church</hi> have no <hi>Authority</hi> to impoſe ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence upon them, it cannot be avoided but ſhe will be over-run with <hi>Hereſies,</hi> and embroiled in inſinite <hi>Quarrels</hi> and <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies,</hi> to the deſtruction of her publick Peace.</p>
               <pb n="14" facs="tcp:63712:13"/>
               <p>The <hi>fourth Propoſition</hi> is, <hi>That we can have no juſt cauſe of withdrawing our</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion <hi>from the</hi> Church <hi>whereof we are</hi> Members, <hi>but when we cannot communicate with it without the</hi> Commiſſion <hi>of a</hi> Sin.</p>
               <p>For if we are bound to Communicate with the <hi>Church</hi> when we can lawfully do ſo, as hath been before proved; it is plain we are bound ſo long to <hi>continue</hi> our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with the <hi>Church,</hi> till it be unlawful to continue in it any longer: But it cannot be unlawful to continue in her Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, till ſhe require ſomething as a Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of her Communion that is a <hi>Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that there are but <hi>Two</hi> caſes, wherein it can be lawful to <hi>withdraw</hi> our <hi>Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> from a <hi>Church,</hi> becauſe there are but two caſes wherein <hi>Communion</hi> with her can be <hi>ſinful.</hi> One is, when the <hi>Church</hi> requires of us, as a <hi>Condition</hi> of her <hi>Communion,</hi> an <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment</hi> and <hi>Profeſſion</hi> of that for a <hi>Truth,</hi> which is an <hi>Errour.</hi> The other is, when the <hi>Church</hi> requires of us, as a Condition of her Communion, the joyn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with her in ſome practices which are againſt the <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>God.</hi> In theſe two Caſes to withdraw our Obedience to the <hi>Church</hi> is ſo far from being a <hi>Sin,</hi> that it is a neceſſary <hi>Duty;</hi> becauſe we have an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation to the <hi>Laws</hi> of God antecedent to that we have to <hi>thoſe</hi> of the <hi>Church;</hi> and we are bound to obey <hi>theſe</hi> no farther
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:63712:13"/>than they are conſonant or agreeable to <hi>thoſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now from this diſcourſe it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear how inſufficient thoſe Cauſes, how unwarrantable thoſe Grounds are, upon which many among us have proceeded to <hi>Separation</hi> from our <hi>Church.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For, <hi>firſt,</hi> If what I have laid down be true, it cannot be true that <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſcriptural Impoſitions</hi> are a warrantable cauſe of <hi>Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration</hi> from a <hi>Church;</hi> ſuppoſing that by <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſcriptural</hi> be meant no more than only what is neither <hi>Commanded</hi> nor <hi>Forbid</hi> in the Scriptures. For the Actions required by theſe <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſcriptural Impoſitions,</hi> are either in themſelves <hi>lawful</hi> to be done, or <hi>not lawful</hi> to be done. If they be in themſelves <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful</hi> to be done, then they do not fall under that notion of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſcriptural</hi> we here ſpeak of; they are downright <hi>Sins,</hi> and ſo either <hi>particularly</hi> or in the <hi>general,</hi> forbid in the <hi>Scripture.</hi> If they be in themſelves <hi>lawful</hi> to be done, then it cannot be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned how their being <hi>commanded</hi> can make them <hi>unlawful:</hi> So that in this caſe, there is no <hi>Sin</hi> in yielding obedience to the <hi>Church,</hi> and conſequently no cauſe of withdrawing our Communion from it.</p>
               <p>Neither <hi>ſecondly</hi> can it be true, that <hi>Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours</hi> in a <hi>Church</hi> as to matter of <hi>Doctrines</hi> or <hi>Corruptions</hi> as to matter of <hi>Practice,</hi> ſo long as thoſe <hi>Errours</hi> and <hi>Corruptions</hi> are
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:63712:14"/>only <hi>ſuffered,</hi> but not <hi>impoſed,</hi> can be a ſufficient cauſe of <hi>Separation;</hi> the reaſon is, becauſe theſe things are not <hi>Sins</hi> in us, ſo long as we do not joyn with the <hi>Church</hi> in them. So that ſo long as we can Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with a <hi>Church,</hi> without either profeſſing her <hi>Errours,</hi> or partaking in her <hi>ſinful Practices,</hi> as in the preſent caſe it is ſuppoſed we may do; ſo long we are bound upon the <hi>Principle</hi> before laid down not to <hi>ſeparate</hi> from her.</p>
               <p>Neither in the <hi>third</hi> and laſt place is the enjoying a more <hi>profitable Miniſtery,</hi> or living under a more <hi>pure Diſcipline</hi> in a <hi>ſeparate Congregation</hi> a juſt Cauſe of forſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Communion of the Church of which we are Members. And the reaſon is, becauſe we are not to commit a <hi>Sin</hi> for the promoting a good end. Now (as we have ſaid) it is a <hi>Sin</hi> to forſake the Communion of the Church, whereof we are <hi>Members,</hi> ſo long as her <hi>Communion</hi> is not ſinful: But the enjoyment of a <hi>leſs profitable Miniſtery,</hi> or a <hi>leſs pure Diſcipline,</hi> doth not make her <hi>Communion ſinful;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the enjoyment of a <hi>more profitable Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery</hi> or a <hi>more pure Diſcipline,</hi> cannot make a <hi>Separation</hi> from her <hi>lawful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus have I, as briefly as I could, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented to you the Particulars of that Duty we owe to our <hi>common Mother,</hi> in the <hi>preſervation</hi> of her <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> and <hi>Communion.</hi>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:63712:14"/>And I hope I have not been ſo zealous for <hi>Peace,</hi> as to have been at all injurious to <hi>Truth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I am confident I have ſaid nothing but what is very agreeable to <hi>Scripture</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and the Senſe of the Beſt and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enteſt <hi>Chriſtians:</hi> And I am certain I have not intrenched upon any of thoſe Grounds upon which our <hi>Anceſtors</hi> proceeded, to the <hi>Reformation</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> among us. And for moſt of the things here delivered, we have alſo the <hi>Suffrage</hi> of ſeveral, and thoſe the moſt learned and moderate of our <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now, if after this, any one be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, as indeed theſe kind of Diſcourſes are ſeldom very acceptable; all I can ſay, is this, That the <hi>Truths</hi> here delivered, are really of ſo great importance to <hi>Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> and the <hi>publick Peace,</hi> that they ought not to be diſſembled or ſuppreſſed, for any bad <hi>Reception</hi> they may meet with from <hi>ſome Men:</hi> But as for the <hi>manner</hi> of delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring them, I have taken all the care I could, not to give offence to any.</p>
               <p>I now paſs on to the <hi>ſecond</hi> part of my <hi>Task</hi> upon this <hi>Head;</hi> which is to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>Duty</hi> recommended in the <hi>Text,</hi> with relation to <hi>particular Chriſtians,</hi> our <hi>Brethren.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="18" facs="tcp:63712:15"/>
               <p>And here my Buſineſs is, to direct you to the <hi>Purſuit</hi> of <hi>thoſe things that make for Peace;</hi> as <hi>Peace</hi> ſignifies mutual <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Charity,</hi> in oppoſition to <hi>Strife</hi> and <hi>Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs</hi> and <hi>Contentions.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>The things that make for Peace,</hi> in this ſenſe, are more eſpecially theſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, which I ſhall deliver by way of <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Advices.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>first Rule</hi> is, to diſtinguiſh careful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly between matters of <hi>Faith,</hi> and matters of <hi>Opinion;</hi> and as to theſe latter, to be willing that every one ſhould enjoy the liberty of judging for himſelf.</p>
               <p>This is one thing that would help very much to the extinguiſhing of thoſe unna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural <hi>Heats</hi> and <hi>Animoſities,</hi> which have long been the Reproach of Chriſtians. If Men would ſet no greater value upon their <hi>Notions</hi> and <hi>Opinions,</hi> than they do de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve; if they would make a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <hi>neceſſary</hi> Points, and thoſe that are not ſo; and in thoſe things that are not <hi>neceſſary,</hi> would not rigorouſly tie up others to their meaſures, but would allow every Man to abound in his own ſenſe, ſo long as the <hi>Church's Peace</hi> is not hereby injured, we ſhould not have ſo many bitter Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels and Heart-burnings among us. But, alas! whilſt every one will frame a <hi>Syſtem</hi> of <hi>Divinity</hi> of his own head, and every puny <hi>Notion</hi> of that <hi>Syſtem</hi> muſt be <hi>Chriſten'd</hi>
                  <pb n="19" facs="tcp:63712:15"/>by the name of an <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>Faith;</hi> and every Man that doth not believe juſt as he doth, muſt ſtreight be a <hi>Heretick</hi> for not doing ſo: How can it be expected but we muſt wrangle eternally?</p>
               <p>It were heartily to be wiſhed, that Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians would conſider that the <hi>Articles</hi> of <hi>Faith,</hi> thoſe things that God hath made neceſſary by every one to be believed in order to his <hi>Salvation,</hi> are but very <hi>few;</hi> and they are all of them ſo <hi>plainly</hi> and <hi>clearly</hi> ſet down in the <hi>Scripture,</hi> that it is impoſſible for any ſincere honeſt-minded Man to miſs of the <hi>true ſenſe</hi> of them. And they have farther this Badge to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them from all other <hi>Truths,</hi> that they have an immediate influence upon Men's <hi>Lives,</hi> a direct Tendency to make Men <hi>Better;</hi> whereas moſt of thoſe things that make the matter of our Controverſies, and about which we make ſuch a noiſe and clamour, and for which we ſo bitterly cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure and <hi>Anathematize</hi> one another, are quite of another nature: They are neither ſo <hi>clearly revealed</hi> or <hi>propounded</hi> in the Scripture, but that even good Men, through the great difference of their Parts, Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Education, may, after their beſt Endeavours, vary in their Sentiments about them. Nor do they at all concern a <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Life,</hi> but are matters of pure <hi>Notion</hi>
                  <pb n="20" facs="tcp:63712:16"/>and <hi>Speculation.</hi> So that it cannot with any reaſon be pretended that they are <hi>Points</hi> upon which Men's <hi>Salvation</hi> doth depend. It cannot be thought that <hi>God</hi> will be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended with any Man for his <hi>Ignorance</hi> or <hi>Miſtakes</hi> concerning them. And, if not, if a Man may be a <hi>good Chriſtian,</hi> and go to Heaven, whether he holds the right or the wrong ſide in theſe matters, for God's ſake, why ſhould we be <hi>angry</hi> with any one for having other Opinions about them than we have? Why ſhould we not rather permit Men to uſe their <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtandings</hi> as well as they can; and where they fail of the <hi>Truth,</hi> to bear with them, as <hi>God</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf without queſtion will; than by ſtick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for every unneceſſary <hi>Truth,</hi> deſtroy that <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Love,</hi> and <hi>Amity</hi> that ought to be among <hi>Chriſtians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> thing I would recommend, is a great <hi>Simplicity</hi> and <hi>Purity</hi> of <hi>Intention</hi> in the purſuit of <hi>Truth;</hi> and at no hand to let <hi>Paſſion</hi> or <hi>Intereſt,</hi> or any <hi>Self-end</hi> be ingredient into our <hi>Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The practice of this would not more conduce to the diſcovery of <hi>Truth,</hi> than it would to the promoting of Peace: For it is eaſie to obſerve, that it is not always a pure Concernment for the Truth, in the Points in Controverſie, that makes us ſo zealous, ſo fierce, and ſo obſtinate in our
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:63712:16"/>Diſputes for or againſt them; but ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, of which that is only the <hi>Mask</hi> and <hi>Pretence,</hi> ſome <hi>By-ends</hi> that muſt be ſerved, ſome <hi>Secular Intereſt</hi> that we have eſpouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which muſt be carried on.</p>
               <p>We have either engaged our ſelves to ſome <hi>Party,</hi> and ſo its Intereſts, right or wrong, muſt be promoted: Or we have taken up an Opinion inconſiderately at the firſt, and appeared in the favour of it, and afterward our own Credit doth oblige us to defend it: Or we have received ſome <hi>Slight</hi> or <hi>Diſappointment</hi> from the Men of <hi>one Way,</hi> and ſo in pure pet and revenge we paſs over to their Adverſaries: Or it is for our gain and advantage, that the Differences among us be ſtill kept on foot: Or we deſire to get our ſelves a Name by ſome great <hi>Atchievements</hi> in the Noble <hi>Science</hi> of <hi>Controverſies:</hi> Or we are poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with the Spirit of Contradiction: Or we delight in Novelties: Or we love to be ſingular.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the things that too often both give birth to our Controverſies, and alſo nouriſh and foment them.</p>
               <p>If we would but caſt theſe <hi>Beams</hi> out of our eyes, we ſhould both ſee more <hi>clearly,</hi> and certainly live more <hi>peaceably,</hi> But whilſt we purſue <hi>baſe</hi> and <hi>ſordid Ends</hi> under the pretence of maintaining <hi>Truth,</hi>
                  <pb n="22" facs="tcp:63712:17"/>we ſhall always be in <hi>Errour,</hi> and always in <hi>Contention.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us therefore quit our ſelves of all our prepoſſeſſions; let us mortifie all our <hi>Pride</hi> and <hi>Vain-glory,</hi> our <hi>Paſſion</hi> and <hi>Emu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> our <hi>Covetuouſneſs</hi> and <hi>Revenge;</hi> and bring nothing in the World to our <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates</hi> about Religion, but only the <hi>pure Love</hi> of <hi>Truth;</hi> and then our Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies will not be ſo long, and they will be more calmly and peaceably managed, and they will redound to the greater good of all <hi>Parties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this I dare ſay farther, to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage you to labour after this Temper of Mind, That he that comes thus qualified to the Study of <hi>Religion,</hi> though he may not have the luck always to light on the <hi>Truth,</hi> yet with all his <hi>Errours,</hi> be they what they will, he is more acceptable to God, than the Man that hath <hi>Truth</hi> on his ſide, yet takes it up or maintains it to ſerve a turn. He that believes a <hi>Falſhood</hi> after he hath uſed his ſincere endeavours to find the <hi>Truth,</hi> is not half ſo much a <hi>Heretick</hi> as he that profeſſeth a <hi>Truth</hi> out of <hi>evil Principles,</hi> and proſtituteth it to <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy Ends.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>third Rule</hi> is, Never to quarrel about <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Phraſes;</hi> but ſo long as other Men <hi>mean</hi> much-what the ſame
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:63712:17"/>that we do, let us be content, though they have not the luck to <hi>expreſs</hi> themſelves ſo well.</p>
               <p>I do not know how it comes to paſs, whether through too much heat and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerneſs of diſputing, that we do not mind one another's <hi>Senſe,</hi> or whether through too much love to our own manner of <hi>Thinking</hi> or <hi>Speaking,</hi> that we will not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure any thing but what is conveyed to us in our own <hi>Methods:</hi> But, really, it often happens that moſt bitter Quarrels do com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, not ſo much from the different <hi>Senſe</hi> of the contending Parties concerning the things they contend about, as from the different <hi>Terms</hi> they uſe to expreſs the ſame <hi>Senſe,</hi> and the different <hi>Grounds</hi> they proceed upon, or <hi>Arguments</hi> they make uſe of for the proof of it.</p>
               <p>For my part, I verily believe that this is the Caſe of ſeveral of thoſe <hi>Diſputes,</hi> in which we <hi>Proteſtants</hi> do often engage at this day. I do not think, in many Points, our <hi>Differences</hi> are near ſo wide as they are ſometimes repreſented, but that they might eaſily be made up with a little allowance to Men's <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Phraſes,</hi> and the different <hi>Methods</hi> of deducing their Notions.</p>
               <p>It would be, perhaps, no hard matter to make this appear in thoſe <hi>Controverſies</hi> that are ſo much agitated among us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:63712:18"/>
                  <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Juſtification,</hi> and the <hi>ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of good Works to Salvation;</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted Righteouſneſs,</hi> and the <hi>difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Vertue and Grace;</hi> with ſome others, if this were a fit place for it. The Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference that is among us as to theſe Points, is, poſſibly, not much greater than this, That ſome Men, in theſe Matters, ſpeak more clearly and fully; others, more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfectly and obſcurely. Some Men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey their ſenſe in plain and proper words; others delight in <hi>Metaphors,</hi> and do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps too far extend the <hi>Figurative</hi> Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of <hi>Scripture:</hi> Some reaſon more cloſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and upon more certain <hi>Principles;</hi> o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers poſſibly may proceed upon weaker Grounds, and miſapply <hi>Texts</hi> of <hi>Scripture,</hi> and diſcourſe more looſly. But both <hi>Parties</hi> (eſpecially the more moderate of both) ſeem to drive at much-what the ſame thing, though by different ways; as appears from this, That being interrogated concerning the <hi>Conſequences</hi> of their ſeveral <hi>Opinions,</hi> they generally agree in <hi>admitting</hi> or <hi>reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> the ſame.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Another thing that would make for <hi>Peace,</hi> is this; Never to charge upon Men the <hi>Conſequences</hi> of their <hi>Opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons,</hi> when they expreſly diſown them.</p>
               <p>This is another thing that doth huge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly tend to widen our Differences, and to exaſperate Men's Spirits one againſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other;
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:63712:18"/>when having examin'd ſome <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion</hi> of a <hi>Man,</hi> or <hi>Party</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> and finding very great <hi>Abſurdities</hi> and evil <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences</hi> neceſſarily to flow from it, we preſently throw all thoſe into the <hi>Diſh</hi> of them that hold the <hi>Opinion;</hi> as if they could not own the <hi>one,</hi> but they muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily own the <hi>other:</hi> Whereas, indeed, the Men we thus charge, may be ſo inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in this matter, that they do not in the leaſt dream of ſuch <hi>Conſequences;</hi> or if they did, they would be ſo far from <hi>owning</hi> them, that they would abhor the <hi>Opinion</hi> for their ſakes.</p>
               <p>To give you an Inſtance or two in this matter: It is a Doctrine maintained by ſome, That <hi>God's Will is the Rule of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice;</hi> or, That <hi>every thing is therefore just or good, becauſe God wills it.</hi> Thoſe that are concerned to oppoſe this Doctrine, do contend that if this <hi>Doctrine</hi> be true, it will neceſſarily follow, that no Man can have any Certainty of the <hi>Truth</hi> of any one <hi>Propoſition</hi> that God hath revealed in Scripture; becauſe, ſay they, his Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Faithfulneſs and Veracity are by this <hi>Doctrine</hi> made Arbitrary Things. Grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now that this can by juſt conſequence be made out, yet I dare ſay, thoſe that hold the aforeſaid <hi>Doctrine</hi> would be very angry, and had good reaſon ſo to be, if they were told that they did not, no, nor
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:63712:19"/>could not, upon their <hi>Principles,</hi> certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe the <hi>Scripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some Men think that they can with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrative Evidence make out, that the <hi>Doctrine</hi> of <hi>God's Irreſpective Decrees</hi> doth, in its Conſequences, overthrow the whole <hi>Goſpel;</hi> that it doth deſtroy the nature of <hi>Rewards</hi> and <hi>Puniſhments,</hi> cuts the very <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news</hi> of Men's Endeavours after Vertue, makes all <hi>Laws, Promiſes, Exhortations,</hi> perfectly idle and inſignificant things, and renders God the moſt <hi>unlovely Being</hi> in the World. Now ſuppoſing all this to be true, yet it would be a moſt unjuſt and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable thing to affirm of any that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Doctrine, (many of whom are certainly pious and good Men,) that they do maintain any ſuch impious and blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous Opinions as thoſe that are now mentioned.</p>
               <p>The Sum of all is, that a Man may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a <hi>Propoſition,</hi> and not believe all that follows from it: Not but that all the <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions</hi> from a <hi>Propoſition</hi> are equally true, and equally credible with the <hi>Propoſition</hi> from whence they are deduced: But a Man may not ſo clearly ſee through the <hi>Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as to diſcern that ſuch <hi>Conſequences</hi> are really deducible from it: So that we are at no hand to charge them upon him, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs he do explicitely own them.</p>
               <p>If this Rule was obſerv'd, our Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:63712:19"/>would not make ſo great a noiſe, nor would the <hi>Errours</hi> and <hi>Heterodoxes</hi> main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained among us appear ſo monſtrous and extravagant; and we ſhould ſpare a great many hard words, and odious appellations, which we now too prodigally beſtow upon thoſe that differ from us.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Fifth</hi> Rule is, To abſtract Men's <hi>Perſons</hi> from their <hi>Opinions;</hi> and in exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining or oppoſing <hi>theſe,</hi> never to make any reflections upon thoſe.</p>
               <p>This is a thing ſo highly reaſonable, that methinks no Pretender to Ingenuity ſhould ever need to be called upon to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it: For it ſeems very abſurd and ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous in any <hi>Argument,</hi> to meddle with that that nothing concerns the <hi>Queſtion.</hi> But what do <hi>Perſonal Reflections</hi> concern the <hi>Cauſe</hi> of <hi>Religion?</hi> Whatever it may be to the <hi>Reputation</hi> of an <hi>Opinion,</hi> I am ſure it is nothing to the <hi>Truth</hi> of it, that ſuch or ſuch a Man holds it.</p>
               <p>And truly, if Men would leave this Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertinence, we might hope for a better Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue of our <hi>Religious Debates:</hi> But whilſt Men will forſake the <hi>Merits</hi> of the <hi>Cauſe,</hi> and unmanly fall to railing, and diſpara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging Men's <hi>Perſons,</hi> and ſcraping together all the ill that can be ſaid of them, they blow the Coals of Contention, they ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter and envenom the Diſpute, that it rankles into incurable Diſtaſtes and Heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burnings.</p>
               <pb n="36" facs="tcp:63712:20"/>
               <p>Chriſtians would do well to conſider, that theſe mean Arts of expoſing Men's <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> to diſcredit their <hi>Opinions,</hi> are very much unworthy the <hi>Dignity</hi> of their <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion,</hi> and moſt of all miſ-becoming the <hi>Sacredneſs</hi> and <hi>Venerableneſs</hi> of the <hi>Truth</hi> they contend for. And beſides, no Cauſe ſtands in need of them, but ſuch an one as is extremely baſſled and deſperate; and even then they are the worſt Arguments in the World to ſupport it, for quick-ſighted Men will eaſily ſee through the Duſt we endeavour to raiſe; and thoſe that are duller will be apt to ſuſpect from our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo angry and ſo waſpiſh, that we have but a bad Matter to manage.</p>
               <p>We ſhould conſider that Men's <hi>Perſons</hi> are <hi>ſacred</hi> things; that whatever power we have to judge of their <hi>Opinions,</hi> we have no Authority to judge or cenſure <hi>Them:</hi> That to bring <hi>Them</hi> upon the Stage, and there throw Dirt on them, is highly rude and uncivil, and an Affront to <hi>Humane So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety,</hi> and the moſt contrary thing in the World to <hi>Chriſtian Charity,</hi> which is ſo far from enduring Reproaches and Evil-ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that it obliges us to cover as much as we can all the <hi>Faults,</hi> and even the very <hi>Indiſcretions</hi> of others.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Sixth</hi> and laſt thing I ſhall recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to you as an Expedient of <hi>Peace,</hi> is, a vigorous Purſuit of <hi>Holineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="37" facs="tcp:63712:20"/>
               <p>Do but ſeriouſly ſet your ſelves to be <hi>good,</hi> do but get your <hi>Hearts</hi> deeply affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Religion as well as your <hi>Heads,</hi> and then there is no fear but you will be all the <hi>Sons of Peace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We may talk what we will, but really it is our not <hi>practiſing</hi> our <hi>Religion</hi> that makes us ſo <hi>Contentious</hi> and <hi>Diſputatious</hi> about it: It is our <hi>Emptineſs</hi> of the <hi>Divine Life,</hi> that makes us ſo <hi>full</hi> of Speculation and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie: Was but <hi>That</hi> once firmly rooted in us, theſe <hi>Weeds</hi> and <hi>Excreſcencies</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> would preſently dry up and wither; we ſhould loath any longer to feed upon ſuch <hi>Husks,</hi> after we once came to have a Reliſh of that <hi>Bread.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Ah! How little Satisfaction can all our pretty <hi>Notions</hi> and fine-ſpun <hi>Controverſies</hi> yield to a Soul that truly hungers and thirſts after Righteouſneſs? How pitifully, flatly and inſipidly will they taſte, in compariſon of the Divine Entertainments of the <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> Life.</p>
               <p>Were we but ſeriouſly taken up with the <hi>Subſtantials</hi> of our <hi>Religion,</hi> we ſhould not have leiſure for the <hi>Talking, Diſputing Divinity;</hi> we ſhould have greater matters to take up our Thoughts, and more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable Arguments to furniſh out our Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes. So long as we could buſie our ſelves in working out our <hi>Salvation,</hi> and furthering the <hi>Salvation</hi> of others, we
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:63712:21"/>ſhould think it but a mean Employment to ſpend our time in ſpinning <hi>fine Nets</hi> for the catching of <hi>Flies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Beſides, this <hi>Divine Life,</hi> if it once took place in us, would ſtrangely dilate and enlarge our hearts in <hi>Charity</hi> towards our <hi>Brethren;</hi> it would make us open our arms wide to the whole Creation; it would perfectly work out of us all that Peeviſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Sowrneſs, and Penuriouſneſs of Spirit, which we do too often contract by being addicted to a <hi>Sect;</hi> and would make us Sweet and Benign, and Obliging, and ready to receive and embrace all Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Men. In a Word, It would quite ſwallow up all <hi>Diſtinctions</hi> of <hi>Parties;</hi> and whatever did but bear upon it the <hi>Image</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> and the <hi>Superſcription</hi> of the Holy <hi>Jeſus,</hi> would need no other Commendato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries to our Affection, but would upon that alone account be infinitely dear and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious to us.</p>
               <p>Let us all therefore earneſtly contend af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this Divine Principle of <hi>Holineſs;</hi> let us bring down <hi>Religion</hi> from our <hi>Heads</hi> to our <hi>Hearts,</hi> from Speculation to Practice: Let us make it our buſineſs heartily to love God, and do his Will, and then we may hope to ſee <hi>Peace</hi> in our days.</p>
               <p>This, this is that that will reſtore to the World the Golden Age of <hi>Primitive Chriſtianity,</hi> when the <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity</hi> of
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:63712:21"/>the Diſciples of <hi>Jeſus</hi> was ſo conſpicuous and remarkable, that it became into a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verb, See how the Chriſtians love one another.</hi> This, this is that that will bring in the Accompliſhment of all thoſe glorious <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes</hi> of <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Tranquility</hi> that <hi>Christ</hi> hath made to his <hi>Church:</hi> Then ſhall the <hi>Wolf</hi> dwell with the <hi>Lamb,</hi> and the <hi>Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard</hi> lie down with the <hi>Kid:</hi> Then ſhall not <hi>Ephraim</hi> envy <hi>Judah,</hi> nor <hi>Judah</hi> vex <hi>Ephraim;</hi> but we ſhall turn our <hi>Swords</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Plough-ſhares,</hi> and our <hi>Spears</hi> into <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning-hooks;</hi> and there will be no more conſuming or devouring in all God's Holy Mountain.</p>

               <p>THeſe words are the enforcement of an Exhortation which St. <hi>Paul</hi> had made to <hi>Timothy</hi> in the Verſe beforegoing, which was that he ſhould <hi>Avoid prophane and Old-wives Fables;</hi> meaning thoſe impious and ſuperſtitious <hi>Doctrines,</hi> and the carnal and unchriſtian <hi>Obſervances</hi> that were grounded upon them (ſome of which he had mentioned in the beginning of this Chapter) which ſome at that time did endeavour to introduce into
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:63712:23"/>
                  <hi>Christianity:</hi> and inſtead of applying his mind to theſe, that he ſhould rather <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe himſelf unto</hi> true <hi>Godlineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the Exhortation. The Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments wherewith he enforceth it are Two: Firſt, The Unprofitableneſs of theſe Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal and Superſtitious <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Bodily exerciſe</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>profiteth little.</hi> Secondly, The real uſefulneſs of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid Vertue and Godlineſs to all the Purpoſes of life. <hi>Godlineſs is profitable to all things, having a promiſe of this Life, as well as of that which is to come.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall not here meddle at all with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer part of the Apoſtle's <hi>Exhortation</hi> or the <hi>Argument</hi> that hath relation to it; but ſhall apply my ſelf wholly to the latter, craving leave moſt plainly and affectionately to preſs upon you the <hi>Exerciſe</hi> of <hi>Godlineſs,</hi> upon thoſe Grounds and Conſiderations on which the Apoſtle here recommendeth it.</p>
               <p>Indeed to a Man that conſiders well, it will appear the moſt unaccountable thing in the World, that among all thoſe ſeveral <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes</hi> that Mankind buſie themſelves about, this of <hi>Godlineſs</hi> ſhould be in ſo great a meaſure neglected; that Men ſhould be ſo diligent, ſo induſtrious, ſo unwearied, ſome in getting <hi>Estates,</hi> others in purveying for <hi>Pleaſures,</hi> others in learning <hi>Arts</hi> and <hi>Trades,</hi> All in ſome thing or other relating to this <hi>ſenſible</hi> World; and ſo few ſhould
<pb n="43" facs="tcp:63712:23"/>ſtudy to acquaint themſelves with <hi>God,</hi> and the Concernments of their Souls, to learn the <hi>Arts</hi> of Vertue and Religious Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>Certain it is, this <hi>Piece</hi> of <hi>Skill</hi> is not more above our reach than many of thoſe other things we ſo induſtriouſly purſue; nay I am apt to think it is more within our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than moſt of them. For in our other Labours we cannot always promiſe to our ſelves certain ſucceſs. A thouſand things may intervene which we know not of, that may defeat all our plots and deſigns though never ſo carefully laid; but no Man ever ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly undertook the Buſineſs of Religion but he accompliſhed it.</p>
               <p>Nay farther, As we can with greater cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, ſo can we with leſs pains and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty promiſe to our ſelves ſucceſs in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, than we can hope to compaſs moſt of our worldly deſigns which ſo much take up our thoughts. I doubt not in the leaſt but that leſs labour, leſs trouble, leſs ſolicitude will ſerve to make a Man a good <hi>Christian,</hi> than to get an <hi>Eſtate,</hi> or to attain a competent skill in Humane Arts and Sciences.</p>
               <p>And then for other Motives to oblige us to the ſtudy of <hi>Religion,</hi> we have incompara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly more and greater than we can have for the purſuit of any other thing. It is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the greateſt Concernment we have in the World. It is the very thing God ſent us
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:63712:24"/>into the World about. It is the very thing that his Son came down from Heaven to inſtruct us in. It is the very thing by which we ſhall be concluded everlaſtingly happy, or everlaſtingly miſerable, after this life is ended.</p>
               <p>Theſe things well conſidered, we may juſtly (I ſay) ſtand amazed, that Men ſhould be ſo prodigiouſly ſupine and negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in an Affair of this nature and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, as we ſee they generally are.</p>
               <p>If there can any account be given of this matter, I ſuppoſe it muſt be ſome ſuch as this, That the <hi>things</hi> of this <hi>World,</hi> upon which we beſtow our Care, our Time, our Courtſhip, are preſent to us. We ſee them every day before our Eyes; we taſte, we feel the ſweetneſs of them; we are ſenſible that their enjoyment is abſolutely neceſſary to our preſent well-being: But as for ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual matters they lie under a great diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage. They appear to us as at a great di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. We do not apprehend any preſent need we have of them: Nor do we fancy any ſweetneſs or reliſh in them. Nay, on the contrary, we form the moſt frightful and diſmal <hi>Images</hi> of them than can be. We look upon them not only as <hi>flat,</hi> and <hi>unſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voury;</hi> but as things which if we trouble our heads too much about will certainly ruin all our deſigns in this World. We think <hi>Religion</hi> good for nothing but to ſpoil
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:63712:24"/>good company; to make us melancholy and mopiſh; to diſtract us in our Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Employments; and to put ſo many reſtraints upon us, that we can nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with that freedom nor ſucceſs pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue our Temporal Concernments, which we think neceſſary to our happineſs in this World.</p>
               <p>But let us ſuppoſe things to be thus with Religion as we have fancied, yet cannot this be any reaſonable Excuſe for our care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſneſs about it. What though there were no viſible Benefit by a religious life in this World? What though the rewards of our pains about it were only in reverſion? Yet ſince a time will come when it will be our greateſt Intereſt to have been heartily Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious, is it not a madneſs now to neglect it? What tho' <hi>Religion</hi> be a courſe of life difficult and unpleaſant; a way ſtrewed with Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and Thorns; a way which if we follow, we are certainly loſt, as to our hopes of any thing here? Yet ſince a Time will certainly come when we ſhall wiſh that we had been <hi>good Chriſtians,</hi> though we had loſt our <hi>right eyes</hi> and our <hi>right hands</hi> upon the condition; when we ſhall wiſh that we had purchaſed Vertue, tho' at the rate of the loſs of the whole World: For God's ſake why ſhould we not be of the ſame mind now? Who but Fools and Children but will look upon that which ſhall certainly and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:63712:25"/>be, with the ſame regard as if it was now preſent?</p>
               <p>But indeed, this is not the Caſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; This Buſineſs of Piety is not ſo for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable as we often repreſent it. It is no ſuch Enemy to our temporal deſigns. It is a very innocent thing, and will do us no harm; though we look no farther than this preſent World. It will hinder none of our delights or pleaſures, but will allow us to gratifie every <hi>Appetite</hi> that God and Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture hath put into us. And if any Man doubt this, let him name that natural deſire, which the Chriſtian Religion doth forbid, or any way hinder the innocent ſatisfaction of: I am conſident he ſhall be able to name none. Since this is the Caſe then, how much more <hi>Childiſh</hi> than <hi>Children</hi> ſhall we appear if we make ſo little reckoning of it? How inexcuſably Fooliſh ſhall we be, if we will not be at ſome pains to poſſeſs our ſelves of that which will be no manner of Hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to us in our affairs in this World, and will infallibly make us everlaſtingly happy in that which is to come?</p>
               <p>But farther; What if it be certain, that a Life of ſtrict Vertue is not only no Hinde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance to our Temporal deſigns, but a great Furtherance of them? What if it can be proved, that beſides the influence it has on our Happineſs in the next Life, it is alſo the beſt thing in the World to ſerve our turns
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:63712:25"/>in this? And that nothing can ſo much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the bringing about our. <hi>Worldly Aims;</hi> no ſuch ready way to attain to what our very <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> moſt deſires, moſt delights in, as to be ſincerely <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous.</hi> What imaginable pretence can we then have for our contempt of <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue?</hi> If this can be made to appear, ſure all our Objections will be fully anſwered; all our ſcruples ſatisfied; all our prejudices againſt <hi>Religion</hi> wholly removed; and eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one that is not abandoned of his <hi>Fortune</hi> and his <hi>Senſes,</hi> as well as his <hi>Reaſon,</hi> muſt think himſelf concerned to become a Votary to it; ſince he can have no Temptation or Motive to <hi>Vice</hi> which will not more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully draw him to <hi>Vertue;</hi> and all the <hi>ends</hi> that the <hi>one</hi> can pretend to <hi>ſerve,</hi> will much more effectually be <hi>ſerved</hi> by the <hi>other;</hi> and he eſcapes an Eternity of Miſery, and gets everlaſting Life into the Bargain.</p>
               <p>I think it therefore worth the while to ſpend the time now allotted me in making good this Point, and diſcovering ſomething at leaſt of that univerſal <hi>Profitableneſs of Godlineſs</hi> to the purpoſes of <hi>Human Life,</hi> that St. <hi>Paul</hi> in my Text aſſures us of.</p>
               <p>But becauſe the <hi>Studies</hi> of Men are ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely various, and the <hi>Ends</hi> of <hi>Life</hi> to be ſerved, ſo many, that it will be impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſpeak <hi>particularly</hi> of them; it will be needful to pitch upon ſome <hi>general</hi> Heads,
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:63712:26"/>ſuch as, if they do not comprehend <hi>all,</hi> may yet take in <hi>most</hi> of thoſe things, to which the Labours and Endeavours of Men are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, and in the acquiſition of which they have compaſſed their Deſigns; and to ſhew the <hi>ſerviceableneſs</hi> of <hi>Religion</hi> above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther means for the attaining of them. And I think I cannot pitch better than upon thoſe three noted <hi>Idols</hi> of the World, <hi>Wealth</hi> and <hi>Honour</hi> and <hi>Pleaſure;</hi> theſe being the <hi>Goods</hi> which have always been accounted to divide Mankind among them; and into the ſervice of ſome one or <hi>all</hi> of which, All that ſet up for a happy life in this World do liſt them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, how different and diſagreeing ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they be from one another as to their particular Employments and ways of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving. I ſhall therefore make it appear, that <hi>Godlineſs</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> is a very great furtherance to the acquiſition of all theſe; and that no Man can take a more ready way, either to <hi>improve</hi> his <hi>Fortune,</hi> or to <hi>purchaſe</hi> a <hi>Name and Reputation among men,</hi> or to <hi>live comfortably</hi> and <hi>pleaſantly</hi> in this World, than heartily to ſerve <hi>God,</hi> and to live in the practice of every Vertue.</p>
               <p>And in the <hi>Firſt</hi> place, I begin with the <hi>Conduciveneſs of Religion and Godlineſs to improve our outward Fortunes;</hi> the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of it for the <hi>getting</hi> or <hi>encreaſing</hi> an <hi>Eſtate:</hi> For this is the thing to which our
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:63712:26"/>Thoughts are commonly firſt directed, as looking upon it as the Foundation of a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Life in this World.</p>
               <p>But here I deſire not to be miſtaken: I would not be thought to deal with you, as one of our ordinary <hi>Empiricks,</hi> that promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes many brave feats in his <hi>Bill,</hi> which are indeed beyond the power of his <hi>Art:</hi> I do not pretend that <hi>Wealth</hi> and <hi>Opulency</hi> is neceſſarily entailed upon <hi>Religion;</hi> ſo that whoever is <hi>good</hi> ſhall preſently be enabled to make Purchaſes, and to leave Lands and Livings to his Children. <hi>Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es</hi> are one of thoſe things that are not ſo perfectly in our power, that all Men may hope for an equal ſhare of them. The having more or leſs depends oftentimes not ſo much upon our ſelves, as upon that condition and quality in which we were born, the way and courſe of Life into which our Friends put us; and a hundred accidental circumſtances to which our ſelves contribute nothing. But this I ſay, ſuppoſing the vertuous Man in equal cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances with others; ſuppoſing him to ſtand upon the ſame level, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the ſame fortuitous hits and exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal concurrences that they do, and he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="50" facs="tcp:63712:27"/>
               <p>So that, ſo far as the getting of Riches depends upon Humane endeavours; ſo far as it is an <hi>Art,</hi> and falls under <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts</hi> and <hi>Directions;</hi> no Man alive can propoſe a better expedient in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to than a ſerious practice of Religion.</p>
               <p>To make this good, let it be conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, that as to the <hi>means</hi> that do in a more direct and immediate manner influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the getting or improving an Eſtate (I ſpeak of <hi>general means,</hi> ſuch as are of uſe in all conditions of life; for to meddle with the Myſteries of any Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Art or Trade, is not my purpoſe, as indeed it is beyond my skill:) as to ſuch means as theſe, I ſay, none can pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe more effectual than theſe four.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>Prudence,</hi> in adminiſtring our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</item>
                  <item>2. <hi>Diligence,</hi> in that Vocation wherein God hath placed us.</item>
                  <item>3. <hi>Thrift</hi> and good <hi>Husbandry.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>4. Keeping a good Correſpondence with thoſe in whoſe power it is to hinder or promote our Affairs.</item>
               </list>
               <p>If now it do appear that <hi>Godlineſs</hi> doth highly improve a Man in all theſe four reſpects; if it can be ſhewed that all theſe <hi>Fruits</hi> naturally grow and thrive better in a <hi>Religious</hi> Soil than any other, it will evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently follow; that ſuppoſing theſe above
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:63712:27"/>named means do indeed contribute to the making of a Fortune, (and if they do not, no Man knows what doth; and we ſtrangely abuſe our Friends and our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, when upon that account we recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend them to them) it follows, I ſay, that a life of Godlineſs is a mighty advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to a Man for the purpoſes I am ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of.</p>
               <p>And firſt of all, it will be eaſie to ſhew that <hi>Godlineſs</hi> doth above all things tend to <hi>make a man wiſe and prudent, skilful and dexterous in the management of his Affairs of what nature ſoever:</hi> For it doth very much clear and improve a Mans underſtanding, not only by a certain natural efficacy it hath (as I ſhall ſhew hereafter) to purifie the <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Spirits,</hi> upon which the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of our Intellectual Operations doth exceedingly much depend; but alſo by diſpelling thoſe <hi>adventitious clouds</hi> that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe in the diſcerning faculty from the noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome <hi>Fumes</hi> of Luſt and Paſſion.</p>
               <p>All Vice in the very nature of it, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praves and diſtorts a mans judgment, fills our minds with Prejudices, and falſe Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of things; and, no Man that is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the dominion of it, can poſſibly have ſuch a free uſe of his Reaſon as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe he might; for he will commonly ſee things, not as they are in themſelves, but in thoſe diſguiſes and falſe colours which
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:63712:28"/>his Paſſion puts upon them: Upon which account he cannot avoid but he will be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten impoſed upon, and commit a thouſand errours in the management of his Affairs, which the vertuous Man, whoſe Reaſon is pure and untinctur'd, is ſecured from. It cannot be imagined that either he ſhould foreſee events ſo clearly, or ſpy op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities ſo ſagaciouſly, or weigh things ſo impartially, or deliberate ſo calmly, or tranſact ſo cautiouſly, as the Man that is free from thoſe manifold prepoſſeſſions which his mind is fraught with.</p>
               <p>We ſee this every day verified in Men of all Ranks and Conditions, of all Callings and Employments. What a multitude of inconveniences, as to matter of dealing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Man and Man doth an intemperate Appetite betray Men to? How ſilly and fooliſh is the moſt ſhrewd Man, when Wine hath gotten into his head? There is none ſo ſimple in his Company, but ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing him to be ſober, and to have deſigns upon him, he ſhall be able to over-reach him. What a World of Advantages doth the Angry Man give to him he deals with, by the haſtineſs and impatience of his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? How often doth a Man do that in the fury and expectancies of a Luſt, for which when his Ardours are over, he is ready to bite his Nails for very vexation?</p>
               <pb n="53" facs="tcp:63712:28"/>
               <p>It is thus more or leſs with all kind of Vices, they craze a Man's head, and caſt a miſt before his Eyes, and make him often loſe himſelf in thoſe very ways wherein he pretends to be moſt skilful: So that it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be denied, that Vertue is of a ſingular uſe in all matters wherein we have occaſion to make uſe of our Reaſon, and doth ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure us from a multitude of indiſcretions, which without it we ſhould unavoidably commit.</p>
               <p>But ſecondly, <hi>Godlineſs is alſo an excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent means to ſecure a man's diligence in the diſcharge of his Calling and Employment,</hi> which is alſo a matter of very great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence in order to our thriving in the World: for it is the <hi>diligent hand that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth rich,</hi> and the <hi>man that is diligent in his buſineſs, that ſhall ſtand before Kings;</hi> as <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> tells us.</p>
               <p>Now the Obligations that <hi>Religion</hi> lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth upon us to be careful in this point, are far ſtronger than what can ariſe from any other reſpect or conſideration ſoever; for it obligeth us to mind our Buſineſs, not only for our own but for <hi>God</hi>'s ſake: It chargeth the matter upon our Conſciences, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents it to us as a part of that ſervice we owe to our <hi>Creator;</hi> and upon the due performance of which, no loſs than the everlaſting welfare of our Souls doth de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend: for it aſſures us, that he that will
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:63712:29"/>call us to account for every <hi>idle Word,</hi> will much more do ſo for the <hi>idle</hi> expence of our <hi>Time,</hi> and the abuſe and not improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thoſe Talents that he hath entruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us with. So that though we had no worldly inducement to make us diligent in our <hi>Callings,</hi> though we were ſure we ſhould ſuffer no prejudice in our Temporal Affairs by <hi>Idleneſs,</hi> and the neglect of our Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, (the fear of which yet is the only principle that puts Worldly Men upon acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on) nevertheleſs we were infinitely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned not to be ſlack or negligent in this matter, in regard it is a point that will be ſo ſeverely exacted of us in the other World.</p>
               <p>I know but one Objection that can be made againſt this Diſcourſe, and it is this, that what engagements ſoever <hi>Religion</hi> lays upon us to the careful ſpending of our time, yet its own <hi>Exerciſes, Prayer</hi> and <hi>Reading,</hi> and <hi>Meditation,</hi> take up ſo great a portion of it, which might be ſpent in the works of our ordinary Employment, that in effect it rather hinders our atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on our Buſineſs than promotes it. But to this it is eaſily anſwered, that there is no Man ſo engaged in the World, but may if he pleaſe, make both his <hi>Buſineſs</hi> and his <hi>Devotions</hi> conſiſt together without prejudicing of either.</p>
               <pb n="55" facs="tcp:63712:29"/>
               <p>They have very falſe Apprehenſions of Religion, that think it obliges us to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways upon our Knees, or always poring upon ſome good Book: No, we do as tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſerve God, and perform acts of Religion, when we labour honeſtly in our Vocation, as when we go to Church, or ſay our Prayers.</p>
               <p>It is true indeed, we ought to have our hearts in Heaven as much as is poſſible, and to that end we ought to pray continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; but what hinders but we may do this in the midſt of our Buſineſs? There is no employment doth ſo entirely engroſs a Man's mind; but he may find leiſure, if he pleaſe, many times a day, to entertain good thoughts, to quicken and reinforce his purpoſes, to caſt up a ſhort Prayer or a wiſh to God Almighty. And this I dare ſay for your encouragement, that ſuch a devout frame of heart, ſuch frequent and ſudden dartings of your Souls to God, while you are at your Buſineſs, will be ſo far from hindring or diſtracting you in it, that they will make you go about it with much more vigour and alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
               <p>But farther, I would ask any Man that makes the foreſaid Objection, ſuppoſing <hi>Religion</hi> ten times more expenſive of our time than really it is, yet whether <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Sin</hi> be not much more ſo, than it would
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:63712:30"/>be. What a multitude of idle avocations from, and interruptions in our Buſineſs doth that daily occaſion unto Men? What a number of impertinent Diſcourſes, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable Viſits, needleſs points of Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantry, long diverſions by Drink, and Play, and Company; not to mention a great many other Debauches, doth it frequently engage Men in? and yet theſe we count no hindrances to our Buſineſs; theſe we complain not of; but to ſpend a quarter of that time in ſome devout Exerciſe, this is intolerable, it waſts too much of our time, our occaſions will not permit it. Such partial and unjuſt eſtimators of things are we. But I proceed.</p>
               <p>In the third place then, as for <hi>Frugality</hi> and <hi>good Husbandry,</hi> which is another ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary requiſite for the getting of <hi>Wealth. Religion</hi> is unqueſtionably the beſt Miſtreſs of it in the World; for it retrencheth all the exorbitances and wantoneſſes of our Deſires, which are the things that pick the money out of our Purſes, and teacheth us to live after the meaſures of <hi>Nature,</hi> which every body knows are little, and cheap. It perfectly cuts off all thoſe idle expences with which the Eſtates of other Men ſtand almoſt continually charged. The <hi>Modeſty</hi> of it Cloaths us at a ſmall rate; and its <hi>Temperance</hi> ſpreads for us, though a neat,
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:63712:30"/>yet a frugal Table. The attendance it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires on our Buſineſs will not allow us to embezel our money in Drinking or Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming: nor will that <hi>Purity</hi> which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable from it, ever let us know what the vaſt and ſinking expences of lewdneſs and uncleanneſs are. In a word, it is <hi>Vice</hi> only that is the chargeable thing; it is only <hi>Shame</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> that Men buy at ſuch coſtly rates. Godlineſs is ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and full of good Husbandry; nor has it any known or unknown ways of ſpending, except it be thoſe of <hi>Charity</hi> which indeed, in proper ſpeaking, are not ſo much expence, as <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſury;</hi> for money ſo laid out, doth always even in this life return to us with Advantage.</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt means I mentioned of <hi>Thriving</hi> in the World, was the <hi>keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a good Correſpondence with all thoſe in whoſe power it is to hinder or promote our Affairs.</hi> This every body knows to be a prime point in <hi>Policy;</hi> and indeed it is of a large extent, and of continual uſe. No Man can be ſuppoſed ſo independent on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, but that as he is ſome way behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to them for all that he has, ſo he ſtands in need of their help and concurrence for all that he hopes for. men do not make their fortunes of themſelves, nor grow rich by having Treaſures dropped in their Laps;
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:63712:31"/>but they do it by the benefit of Humane Society, by the mutual Aſſiſtances and good Offices that one Man performs for another. So that whoever intends to thrive in the World, it above all things imports him ſo to carry himſelf towards all that he hath any Commerce with, ſo far to ſecure their favour and good will, that they may be obliged not to deny him any of thoſe Aſſiſtances which the Exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of his Affairs calls for at their hands. But now, how this ſhould be done any otherwiſe than by being truly <hi>Just</hi> and <hi>Honest,</hi> by abſtaining from <hi>Violence</hi> and <hi>Injury,</hi> by being <hi>True</hi> to our <hi>Trust,</hi> and <hi>Faithful</hi> in performing our <hi>Contracts;</hi> and, in a word, by doing all thoſe good <hi>Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> to others, which we expect they ſhould do unto us; which, as our Saviour tells us is the Sum of <hi>Religion,</hi> is a very hard thing to conceive.</p>
               <p>The Uſefulneſs, or rather the Neceſſity of ſuch a Behaviour as this, in order to the gaining the good <hi>Opinion</hi> of others, and ſo ſerving our own Ends by them, is ſo univerſally acknowledged, that even thoſe that make no real Conſcience of theſe things, are yet nevertheleſs, in all their Dealings, forced to pretend to them. <hi>Open</hi> and <hi>Bare-faced Knavery</hi> rarely ſerves a Man's turn in this World; but it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Mask of <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Honeſty,</hi> that
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:63712:31"/>it uſually performs thoſe Feats it doth; which is no leſs than a Demonſtration of the Conduciveneſs of thoſe things to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote our Temporal Intereſts: For if the mere <hi>Pretence</hi> to them be a great advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage to us for this purpoſe, it cannot be imagined but that the <hi>Reality</hi> of them will be a greater. Certainly the <hi>Power of Godlineſs</hi> will be able to do more than the <hi>Form</hi> alone; and that if it was up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on no other account than this, that no Man that is but a mere <hi>Pretender</hi> to <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty</hi> can long hope to keep his Credit among Men. It is impoſſible to <hi>act</hi> a <hi>Part</hi> for any long time; let him carry it never ſo cunningly, his <hi>Vizor</hi> will ſome time or other be thrown off, and he will appear in his true Colours; and to what a World of Miſchiefs and Inconveniences he will then be expoſed, every one that knows how hated, how deteſted, how abandon'd by every one a <hi>Knave</hi> and a <hi>Villain</hi> is, may eaſily determine. I hope I need ſay no more to convince you that <hi>Religion</hi> is the beſt <hi>Policy;</hi> and that the more hearty and conſcientious any Man is in the practice of it, the more likely he is to <hi>Thrive</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove</hi> in the World.</p>
               <p>So that I may now proceed to the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> general Point to be ſpoken to, which is, <hi>The Profitableneſs of Religion for the
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:63712:32"/>attaining a good Name and Reputation.</hi> How very much it conduceth to this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, will appear from theſe two Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations.</p>
               <p>Firſt, It lays the <hi>ſurest Grounds</hi> and <hi>Foundations</hi> for a <hi>Good Name</hi> and <hi>Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, Men are generally ſo juſt to it, that it rarely miſſes of a good Name and Reputation: The firſt is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from <hi>Reaſon;</hi> the ſecond, from <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt of all, <hi>Godlineſs</hi> layeth the <hi>truest Foundation</hi> for a <hi>fair Reputation</hi> in the World. There are but two things that can give a Man a Title to the good <hi>Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion</hi> and <hi>Reſpects</hi> of Men; the inward <hi>Worth</hi> and <hi>Dignity</hi> of his <hi>Perſon,</hi> and his <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſefulneſs</hi> and <hi>Serviceableneſs</hi> to others. The firſt of theſe challengeth Men's <hi>Eſteem,</hi> the other their <hi>Love.</hi> Now both theſe Qualities Religion and Vertue do eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly poſſeſs us of.</p>
               <p>For, Firſt, The <hi>Religious</hi> Man is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the moſt <hi>Worthy</hi> and <hi>Excellent</hi> Perſon; for he, of all others, lives moſt up to the great <hi>End</hi> for which he was deſigned, which is the natural meaſure of the <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Worth</hi> of Things.</p>
               <p>Whatever External Advantages a Man may have, yet if he be not endow'd with Vertuous Qualities, he is far from having
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:63712:32"/>any true Worth or Excellence, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently cannot be a fit Object of our <hi>Praiſe</hi> and <hi>Eſteem;</hi> becauſe he wants that which ſhould make him <hi>Perfect</hi> and <hi>Good</hi> in his <hi>Kind.</hi> For it is not a comely Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonage, or a long Race of Famous An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors, or a large Revenue, or a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of Servants, or many ſwelling Titles, or any other thing without a Man, that ſpeaks him a <hi>Compleat Man,</hi> or makes him to <hi>be</hi> what he ſhould be: But the right uſe of his Reaſon, the employing his Liberty and Choice to the beſt purpoſes, the exerciſing his Powers and Faculties about the <hi>fittest Objects,</hi> and in the moſt <hi>due Meaſures;</hi> theſe are the Things that make him <hi>Excellent.</hi> Now none can be ſaid to do this, but only he that is Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Religion alſo is that which makes a Man moſt <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſeful</hi> and <hi>Profitable</hi> to others; for it effectually ſecures his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of all thoſe Duties whereby both the Security and Welfare of the <hi>Publick,</hi> and alſo the Good and Advantage of <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular</hi> Perſons, is moſt attained.</p>
               <p>It makes Men Lovers of their Country, Loyal to their Prince, Obedient to Laws: It is the ſureſt Bond and Preſervative of Society in the World: It obliges us to live peaceably, and to ſubmit our ſelves to our
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:63712:33"/>Rulers, not only for <hi>Wrath,</hi> but alſo for <hi>Conſcience</hi> ſake: It renders us modeſt and governable in Proſperity, and reſolute and couragious to ſuffer bravely in a good Cauſe, in the worſt of Times: It teacheth us to endeavour as much as in us lies to promote the Good of every particular Member of the Community, to be inflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly upright, to do hurt to none, but good Offices to all; to be charitable to the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and Souls of Men, to do all manner of Kindneſſes that lie within our power: It takes off the Sowrneſs and Moroſeneſs of our Spirits, and makes us Affable and Courteous, Gentle and Obliging, and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to embrace with open Arms, and an hearty Love, all Sorts and Conditions of Men.</p>
               <p>In every Relation wherein we can ſtand to one another, it influenceth upon us, in order to the making us more uſeful: It makes <hi>Parents</hi> kind and indulgent, and careful of the Education of their <hi>Children;</hi> and <hi>Children</hi> loving and obedient to their <hi>Parents:</hi> It makes <hi>Servants</hi> diligent to <hi>pleaſe their Maſters, and to do their Work in Singleneſs of Heart, not with Eye-ſervice, as Men-pleaſers, but as unto God;</hi> and it makes <hi>Maſters</hi> gentle and forbearing, and careful to make proviſion for their Family, <hi>as thoſe that know they have a Maſter in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven,</hi> that <hi>is no Reſpecter of Perſons.</hi> In a
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:63712:33"/>word, There is no Condition or Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in which Religion will not be ſignal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an Inſtrument of making us more ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to others, and of doing more good in the World. And if ſuch be the Spirit and Temper of it, how is it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible but it muſt needs acquire a great deal of Reſpect and Love from all ſorts of Men? If Obligingneſs and doing good in one's Generation do not endear a Man to thoſe that know him, do not entitle him to their Love and Affections, what thing in the World is there that is likely to do it?</p>
               <p>But Secondly, <hi>True and unaffected Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſeldom miſſes of a good Reputation in the World.</hi> How unjuſt to Vertue ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Men are in other reſpects, yet in this they generally give it its due; where-ever it appears, it generally meets with Eſteem and Approbation; nay, it has the good Word of many that o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe are not over-fond of Religion: Though they have not the Grace to be <hi>Good</hi> themſelves, yet they rarely have the Confidence not to commend <hi>Goodneſs</hi> in others.</p>
               <p>Add to this, that no Man ever raiſed to himſelf a <hi>Good Name</hi> in the World, but it was upon the ſcore of his <hi>Vertues,</hi> either <hi>Real</hi> or <hi>Pretended. Vice</hi> hath ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times got <hi>Riches,</hi> and advanced it ſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:63712:34"/>
                  <hi>Preferments;</hi> but it never was account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <hi>Honourable</hi> in any Nation.</p>
               <p>It muſt be acknowledged indeed, that it may and doth ſometimes happen that <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi> Men may be had in <hi>Eſteem;</hi> but then it is to be conſidered, that it is not for their <hi>Vices</hi> that they are eſteemed, but for ſome <hi>good Quality</hi> or other they are emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent in. And there is no doubt, if thoſe Men were without thoſe <hi>Vices,</hi> their <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation</hi> would be ſo far from being there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>diminiſhed,</hi> that it would become much more <hi>Conſiderable.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It muſt alſo be acknowledged on the other hand, that even <hi>Vertuous</hi> and <hi>Good</hi> Men may ſometimes fail of that <hi>Eſteem</hi> and <hi>Reſpect</hi> that their Vertue ſeems to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit; nay, in that degree as to be ſlighted and deſpiſed, and to have many <hi>Odious Terms</hi> and <hi>Nick-names</hi> put upon them: But when we conſider the Caſes in which this happens, it will appear to be of no force at all for the diſproving what has been now delivered. For, <hi>First,</hi> It ought to be conſidered what kind of <hi>Perſons</hi> thoſe are that treat <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Vertuous</hi> Men thus <hi>Contemptuouſly;</hi> we ſhall always find them to be the <hi>Worst</hi> and the <hi>Vilest</hi> of Mankind; ſuch who have debauched the natural Principles of their Minds, have loſt all the Notions and Diſtinctions of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> are fallen below the <hi>Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:63712:34"/>of <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> and have nothing to bear up themſelves with but <hi>Boldneſs</hi> and <hi>Confidence, Drollery</hi> and <hi>Scurrility,</hi> and turning into <hi>Ridicule</hi> every thing that is grave and ſerious. But it is with theſe as it is with the <hi>Monſters</hi> and <hi>Extravagances</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> they are but very <hi>Few:</hi> Few in compariſon of the reſt of Mankind, who have wiſer and truer Sentiments of Things: But if they were more nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, no Man of Underſtanding would value what ſuch Men ſaid of him. It looks like a Crime to be commended by <hi>ſuch</hi> Perſons; and may juſtly occaſion a Man to reflect upon his own Actions, and to cry out to himſelf, as <hi>He</hi> did of old, What have I done, that theſe Men ſpeak well of me?</p>
               <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> It cannot be denied but that ſome Perſons who are otherwiſe <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous</hi> and <hi>Religious,</hi> may be guilty of ſuch Indiſcretions as thereby to give others oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to <hi>ſlight</hi> and <hi>deſpiſe</hi> them. But then it is to be conſidered, that this is not to be charged upon <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> but is the <hi>particular Fault</hi> of the <hi>Perſons.</hi> Every one that is <hi>Religious,</hi> is not <hi>Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent;</hi> the Meanneſs of a Man's <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding,</hi> or his raſh and intemperate <hi>Zeal,</hi> or the Moroſeneſs of his <hi>Temper,</hi> or his too great <hi>Scrupuloſity</hi> about little things, may ſometimes make his Behaviour <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couth</hi>
                  <pb n="64" facs="tcp:63712:35"/>

                  <pb n="66" facs="tcp:63712:36"/>and <hi>Fantaſtick,</hi> and betray him to do many Actions which he may think his <hi>Religion</hi> obliges him to, that other People will be apt to fancy <hi>Silly</hi> and <hi>Ridiculous.</hi> But this doth not at all reflect upon <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi> nor doth it follow, that becauſe the <hi>Imprudence</hi> of this or the other particular Man expoſes him to the <hi>Mirth</hi> and the <hi>Pleaſantneſs</hi> of others, that therefore all <hi>Religious Perſons</hi> muſt fall under the ſame <hi>Fate:</hi> Moſt certainly <hi>Religion,</hi> where-ever it is governed by <hi>Knowledge</hi> and <hi>Sound Principles,</hi> where-ever it is managed with <hi>Prudence</hi> and <hi>Diſcretion,</hi> is a thing ſo <hi>Noble,</hi> ſo <hi>Amiable,</hi> that it attracts <hi>Love,</hi> and commands <hi>Reſpect</hi> from all that are acquainted with it, unleſs they be ſuch profligately wicked Perſons as I juſt now ſpoke of.</p>
               <p>There is one <hi>Objection</hi> made from the <hi>Scripture,</hi> againſt this and the former <hi>Point</hi> I have been ſpeaking to, which I deſire to remove before I proceed to the <hi>Third</hi> Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Head of my Diſcourſe. It is this; That the <hi>Scripture</hi> is ſo far from repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Godlineſs</hi> as a means to <hi>improve our For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes,</hi> or <hi>attain a Reputation in the World,</hi> that it ſeems directly to affirm the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; for it aſſures us, that <hi>All thoſe that will live godly in Chriſt, muſt ſuffer Perſecution:</hi> That <hi>the Diſciples of Chriſt ſhall be hated of
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:63712:36"/>all Men, for His Name's ſake:</hi> That <hi>the World ſhall revile and perſecute them, and ſpeak all manner of Evil of them:</hi> And that <hi>through many Tribulations we muſt enter into the Kingdom of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But to this it is eaſily anſwered, that theſe and other ſuch like Paſſages of <hi>Scripture</hi> do not ſpeak the <hi>General</hi> and <hi>Common</hi> Fate that attends Godlineſs in all <hi>Times</hi> and <hi>Places</hi> of the World, according to the <hi>Ordinary</hi> Courſe of God's Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; but only refer to that <hi>particular Time,</hi> when <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> was to be planted in the World; then, indeed, <hi>Perſecution</hi> and <hi>Diſgrace,</hi> Loſs of <hi>Goods,</hi> and even of <hi>Life</hi> it ſelf, was to be the common Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of thoſe that profeſſed it. Nor could it otherwiſe be expected; for, when a new <hi>Religion</hi> is to be ſet up, and ſuch a Religion as is perfectly <hi>deſtructive</hi> of all thoſe others that have been by long <hi>Cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom</hi> received, and are by <hi>Laws</hi> eſtabliſhed in the World, it cannot be imagined but that it will meet with a great deal of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiction and Oppoſition from all ſorts of Perſons. But this was a peculiar and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Caſe, and could but laſt for a certain Time: Now that Chriſtianity hath obtained in the World, and is adopted into the Laws of Kingdoms, as, God be thanked, it is among us at this day; ſo far need we be from fearing that the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice
<pb n="68" facs="tcp:63712:37"/>of it will draw upon us any <hi>Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> or ſuch other Inconveniences as are mention'd in the fore-cited places, that there is no doubt but that we may ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally expect from it all thoſe <hi>External</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits and Advantages, which, as we have ſeen, it is in its own nature apt to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, and which God hath indeed made over to it by <hi>Promiſe,</hi> in ſeveral Paſſages of the <hi>Scripture,</hi> eſpecially of the <hi>Old Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtament.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For that I may mention this by the By, I do not conceive that thoſe Promiſes of <hi>Long Life, Good Days,</hi> and all manner of <hi>Worldly Proſperity,</hi> with which the Practice of <hi>Godlineſs</hi> is ſo frequently enforced in the <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> were ſo appropriated to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Religion, as to be antiquated or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>annualled by the Introduction of the <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian;</hi> but rather that they are ſtill in force to all the Purpoſes they were then; for that the Coming of <hi>Christ</hi> into the World did add many great <hi>Bleſſings</hi> and <hi>Privileges</hi> to the People of God, which before they had not, we are certain of: But that it <hi>took away</hi> from them any that before they had, this we no where read; nor, indeed, is it probable.</p>
               <p>But I haſten to the <hi>Third</hi> and laſt Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Head I am to ſpeak to, which is, <hi>The excellent Miniſteries of Religion, above all
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:63712:37"/>other things, to the Pleaſures of Humane Life.</hi> Which Point, if it be clearly made out, I do not ſee what can be farther want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to recommend it unto us, as the moſt effectual Inſtrument for the ſerving all our turns in this World. Now that Godlineſs doth indeed make the moſt excellent Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for all ſorts of Pleaſures, will appear by theſe four Conſiderations.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, That it eminently miniſtreth to <hi>Health,</hi> which is a neceſſary Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for all <hi>Pleaſures.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Secondly, It doth much increaſe the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> and <hi>Sweetneſs</hi> of all our other <hi>Pleaſures.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Thirdly, It ſecures us from all thoſe <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietudes</hi> and <hi>Diſturbances</hi> which are apt to <hi>embitter</hi> our <hi>Pleaſures,</hi> and make our Lives uncomfortable.</item>
                  <item>Fourthly, It adds to <hi>Humane Life</hi> a World of <hi>Pleaſures</hi> of its own, which thoſe that are not poſſeſſed of it, are utterly unacquainted with.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Firſt of all, <hi>Godlineſs doth very much conduce to Health:</hi> Which is ſo neceſſary to our Enjoyment of any <hi>ſenſible Good,</hi> that without it, neither <hi>Riches,</hi> nor <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,</hi> nor any thing that we eſteem moſt gratifying to our Senſes, will ſignifie any thing at all to us. Now that a <hi>Sound</hi> and <hi>Healthful Conſtitution</hi> does exceedingly much depend upon a diſcreet Government and
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:63712:38"/>Moderation of our Appetites and Paſſions, upon a ſober and temperate Uſe of all God's Creatures, which is an <hi>Eſſential</hi> Part of <hi>True Religion,</hi> is a thing ſo evident, that I need make no words about it. What are moſt of our <hi>Diſeaſes</hi> and <hi>Infirmities,</hi> that make us miſerable and unpity'd while we live, and cut us off in the midſt of our days, and tranſmit Weakneſs and Rottenneſs to our <hi>Poſterity,</hi> but the Effects of our <hi>Exceſſes</hi> and <hi>Debauches,</hi> our <hi>Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs</hi> and <hi>Luxury?</hi> Certainly, if we would obſerve thoſe Meaſures in our <hi>Diet</hi> and in our <hi>Labours,</hi> in our <hi>Paſſions</hi> and in our <hi>Pleaſures,</hi> which Religion has bound us up to, we might to ſuch a degree <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve</hi> our <hi>Bodies,</hi> as to render the greateſt part of <hi>Phyſick</hi> perfectly ſuperfluous. But theſe things are too well known, to need to be inſiſted on: I therefore paſs on to the next thing.</p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>A Life of Religion doth very much increaſe the Reliſh and Sweetneſs of all our ſenſible Enjoyments.</hi> So far is it from abridging us of any of our Earthly De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights, (as its Enemies ſlanderouſly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it,) that it abundantly heightens them. It doth not only indulge to us the free Uſe of all thoſe good Creatures of God which he hath made for the Support and Comfort of Mankind, while they are in theſe Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bodies; but alſo makes them more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitely
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:63712:38"/>quiſitely gratifying and delightful, than without it they could poſſibly be. And this it doth in part by the means of that never ſufficiently commended Temperance and Moderation I before ſpoke of; for hereby it comes to paſs that our <hi>Senſes,</hi> which are the Inſtruments of our Pleaſures, are always preſerv'd in that due Purity and Quickneſs that is abſolutely neceſſary for the right performing of their <hi>Offices,</hi> and the rendring our Perceptions of any thing grateful and agreeable: Whereas the <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual</hi> and <hi>Voluptuous</hi> Man defeats his own Deſigns, and whilſt he thinks to enjoy a <hi>greater</hi> ſhare of <hi>Pleaſures</hi> than other Men, really enjoys a <hi>leſs;</hi> for his Diſſoluteneſs, and giving up the Reins to his Appetites, only ſerves to dull and ſtupifie them. Nor doth he reap any other Benefit from his continual hankering after <hi>Bodily Pleaſures,</hi> but that his <hi>Senſations</hi> of them are hereby made altogether <hi>flat</hi> and <hi>unaffecting.</hi> Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is his <hi>Meat</hi> half ſo ſavoury, nor his <hi>Recreations</hi> ſo diverting, nor his <hi>Sleep</hi> ſo ſweet, nor the <hi>Company</hi> he keeps ſo agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able as <hi>Theirs</hi> are, that by following the Meaſures of <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Reaſon,</hi> come to them with <hi>truer</hi> and more <hi>unforc'd</hi> Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites.</p>
               <p>But beſides this, there is a certain <hi>Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomneſs</hi> and <hi>Chearfulneſs</hi> of mind, which is in a manner <hi>peculiar</hi> to the truly <hi>Religious</hi>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:63712:39"/>Soul, that above all things <hi>ſets off</hi> our <hi>Pleaſures,</hi> and makes all the <hi>Actions</hi> and <hi>Perceptions</hi> of Humane Life <hi>Sweet</hi> and <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful.</hi> True <hi>Piety</hi> is the beſt Cure of <hi>Melancholy</hi> in the World; nothing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parable to it for diſpelling that <hi>Lumpiſhneſs</hi> and <hi>Inactivity,</hi> that renders the Soul of a Man uncapable of enjoying either it ſelf or any thing elſe. It fills the Soul with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual <hi>Light</hi> and <hi>Vigour,</hi> infuſeth a ſtrange kind of <hi>Alacrity</hi> and <hi>Gaiety</hi> of Humour into us. And this it doth not only by remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thoſe things that <hi>Hinder</hi> our Mirth, and make us languiſh in the midſt of our Feſtivities, (ſuch as are the Pangs of an Evil <hi>Conſcience,</hi> and the ſtorms of unmorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied <hi>Paſſions,</hi> of which I ſhall ſpeak in the following particular) but even by a more <hi>Phyſical Efficiency.</hi> It hath really a migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Power to <hi>Correct</hi> and <hi>Exalt</hi> a Man's <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural</hi> Temper. Thoſe Ardent Breathings and Workings wherewith the Pious Soul is continually carried out after God and Vertue, are to the Body like ſo much <hi>Freſh Air</hi> and <hi>Wolſom Exerciſe,</hi> they <hi>Fan</hi> the <hi>Blood,</hi> and keep it from <hi>Setling;</hi> they <hi>Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifie</hi> the <hi>Spirits,</hi> and purge them from thoſe groſſer <hi>Feculencies</hi> which would otherwiſe <hi>Cloud</hi> our <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderstandings,</hi> and make us <hi>dull</hi> and <hi>liſtleſs.</hi> And to theſe effects of <hi>Religion</hi> doth <hi>Solomon</hi> ſeem to allude, when he tells us, that <hi>Wiſdom maketh a man's face to ſhine,</hi> Eccl. 8.1.</p>
               <pb n="73" facs="tcp:63712:39"/>
               <p>Where he ſeems to intimate, that that <hi>Purity</hi> and <hi>Exaltation</hi> into which the <hi>Blood</hi> and <hi>Spirits</hi> of a Man are wrought by the Exerciſe of Vertue and Devotion, doth diffuſe it ſelf even to his <hi>Outward Viſage,</hi> making the <hi>Countenance</hi> clear and ſerene, and filling the <hi>Eyes</hi> with an unuſual kind of Splendor and Vivacity. But whether this be a true Comment on his words or no, certain it is, that <hi>Piety</hi> diſpoſeth a Man to <hi>Mirth</hi> and <hi>Lightneſs</hi> of Heart above all things in the World: and how admirable a <hi>Reliſh</hi> this doth give to all our other <hi>Pleaſures</hi> and <hi>Enjoyments</hi> there is none but can eaſily diſcern.</p>
               <p>Thirdly let it be farther conſidered, that <hi>Godlineſs</hi> is a moſt Effectual <hi>Antidote</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all thoſe <hi>Inquietudes,</hi> and <hi>Evil Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents,</hi> that do either wholly <hi>destroy,</hi> or very much <hi>embitter</hi> the <hi>Pleaſures</hi> of this Life.</p>
               <p>For whilſt it teacheth us to place all our Happineſs in <hi>God Almighty</hi> and <hi>our ſelves</hi> only, whilſt we have learn'd to bring all our Affections and Paſſions, our Deſires and Averſions, our Hopes and Fears under the command of our <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour not ſo much to ſuit <hi>Things</hi> to our <hi>Wills,</hi> as our <hi>Wills</hi> to <hi>Things;</hi> being In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different to all Events that can happen, ſave only that we always judge thoſe Beſt
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:63712:40"/>which God in his Providence ſends us. Being, I ſay thus diſpoſed (as certainly Religion, if it be ſuffered to have its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect work upon us, will thus diſpoſe us,) what is it that ſhall be able to diſturb or interrupt our <hi>Pleaſures,</hi> or create any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble or Vexation to us? Our <hi>Preſent Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> will not be <hi>embittered</hi> with the fear of loſing them, or <hi>leſſened</hi> by our Impatient Longing after <hi>Greater.</hi> Our <hi>Brains</hi> will not be upon the <hi>Rack</hi> for Compaſſing things that are perhaps Impoſſible, nor our <hi>Bodies</hi> under the Scourge of <hi>Rage</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> for every Diſappointment. We ſhall not look pale with <hi>Envy</hi> that our <hi>Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours</hi> have that which <hi>we</hi> have not, nor pine away with <hi>Grief</hi> if we ſhould happen to loſe that which we have.</p>
               <p>But the <hi>Vicious</hi> Man is expoſed to all theſe Miſeries, and a thouſand more; he carries that within him, which will perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually fret and torment him, for he is a <hi>Slave</hi> to his <hi>Paſſions;</hi> and the leaſt of them, when it is let looſe upon him, is the <hi>Worſt</hi> of <hi>Tyrants.</hi> He is like the <hi>Troubled Sea,</hi> reſtleſs and ever working, ruffled and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compoſed with every thing. He is not capable of being rendred ſo much as <hi>Tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably Happy</hi> by the beſt condition this World affords: For having ſuch a World of Impetuous <hi>Deſires</hi> and <hi>Appetites</hi> which muſt be all <hi>ſatisfied,</hi> or elſe he is miſerable;
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:63712:40"/>and there being ſuch an infinite number of <hi>Circumſtances</hi> that muſt concur to the gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving them that <hi>Satisfaction:</hi> And all theſe depending upon <hi>Things without him,</hi> which are perfectly out of his Power, it cannot be avoided but he will continually find matter to diſquiet him, and render his condition troubleſome and uneaſie: a thouſand un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſeen Accidents will ever be croſſing his Deſigns. Nor will there be wanting ſome little Thing or other, almoſt hourly to put him out of Humour.</p>
               <p>And if this be the Caſe of the <hi>Vicious</hi> Man, in the <hi>Beſt Circumſtances</hi> of this World, (where the cauſes of Vexation are in a manner undiſcernable) in what a miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Condition muſt he needs be under thoſe more <hi>Real Afflictions</hi> unto which Humane Life is obnoxious? what is there that ſhall be able to ſupport his Spirit under the Tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of a <hi>Lingering Sickneſs,</hi> or the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh of an <hi>Acute Pain?</hi> What is become of all his Mirth and Jollity, if there ſhould hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen a <hi>Turn</hi> in His <hi>Fortune,</hi> if he ſhould fall into <hi>Diſgrace,</hi> or his Friends forſake him, or the Means of maintaining his Pleaſures fail him, and the miſerable Man become <hi>Poor</hi> and <hi>Deſpiſed?</hi> Not to mention a great many more Evils, which will make him uncapable of any Conſolation, eat into the Heart of his beſt Enjoyments, and become <hi>Gall</hi> and <hi>Wormwood</hi> to his Choiceſt Delica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies.</p>
               <pb n="76" facs="tcp:63712:41"/>
               <p>And has he not now, think you, made <hi>admirable</hi> Proviſions for his <hi>Pleaſures?</hi> Has he not done himſelf a wonderful Piece of Service, by freeing himſelf from the <hi>Drud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery</hi> as he calls it, of Vertue and Religion? Alas, <hi>Poor Man!</hi> this is the only Thing that would now have ſecured him from all theſe ſad <hi>Accidents</hi> and <hi>Diſpleaſures.</hi> The <hi>Good Man</hi> ſits above the <hi>Reach</hi> of <hi>Fortune,</hi> and in ſpite of all the Viciſſitudes and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainties of this <hi>Lower World,</hi> with which other Men are continually Alarm'd, enjoys a Conſtant and Undiſturbed Peace. Thoſe <hi>Evils</hi> that may be <hi>Avoided,</hi> (and really a great many which afflict mortal Men, are ſuch) he by his Prudent Conduct and Government of himſelf wholly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents. And thoſe that are <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>navoidable,</hi> he takes by ſuch a <hi>Handle,</hi> that they have no power to do him any <hi>Harm:</hi> For he is indeed poſſeſſed of that which the <hi>Alchy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſts</hi> in vain ſeek for: Such a <hi>Sovereign Art</hi> he has, that he can turn the <hi>Baſest Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals</hi> into <hi>Gold,</hi> make ſuch an uſe of the <hi>worſt Accidents</hi> that can befal him, that they ſhall not be accounted his <hi>Miſeries,</hi> but his <hi>Enjoyments.</hi> So that however the varieties of his Condition may occaſion a <hi>change</hi> in his <hi>Pleaſures,</hi> yet can they never cauſe any <hi>Loſs</hi> or <hi>Deſtruction</hi> of them.</p>
               <pb n="77" facs="tcp:63712:41"/>
               <p>And this ſecurity he enjoys, not as ſome of the <hi>Stoicks</hi> of old pretended to do, by an Imaginary <hi>Inſenſibility,</hi> or by changing the <hi>names</hi> of <hi>Things,</hi> calling that <hi>no Evil</hi> which Really is one: but by an abſolute Reſignation of himſelf to the Will of <hi>God,</hi> and an Hearty acquieſcing in his wiſe Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. He is certain there is a God that governs the World, and that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing happens to him, but by his Order and Appointment. And he is certain alſo that this God hath a real Kindneſs for him, and would not diſpenſe any Event unto him, but what is really for his Good and Advantage. And theſe thoughts ſo ſupport his Spirit, that he not only bears patiently, but thanks God for whatever happens to him. And inſtead of Fretting and Complaining that things ſucceed other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe than he expected, he reſolves with himſelf that that Condition, whatever it be, in which he actually is, is indeed beſt for him; and that which he himſelf, were he to be the Carver of his Fortunes, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing him but truly to underſtand his own Concernments, would chuſe for himſelf above all others.</p>
               <p>But farther, beſides this ſecurity from <hi>Outward Diſturbances</hi> which our Vertue obtains for us, there is another <hi>Evil</hi> which it alſo delivers us from, with which the wicked Man is almoſt perpetually haunted,

                  <pb n="78" facs="tcp:63712:43"/>and which ſeldom ſuffers him to enjoy any ſincere, unmingled Pleaſure. That which I mean is the <hi>Pangs</hi> of an <hi>Evil Conſcience,</hi> the Fears, the Reſtleſneſs, the Confuſion, the Amazements that ariſe in his Soul from the ſenſe of his Crimes, and the juſt Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of the Shame and Vengeance that doth await them, poſſibly in this Life, but moſt certainly in the Life to come.</p>
               <p>How Happy, how Proſperous ſoever the Sinner be as to his other Affairs, yet theſe Furies he ſhall be ſure to be plagued with: no pompouſneſs of Condition, no coſtly Entertainments, no noiſe of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany will be able to drive them away. Every Man that is wicked cannot but know that he is ſo, and that very Knowledge is a Principle of perpetual Anguiſh and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude. Be his Crimes never ſo ſecret, yet he cannot be confident they will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways continue ſo: and the very Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this makes him feel all the Shame and Amazement of a preſent Diſcovery. But put the caſe he hath had the good luck to ſin ſo cloſely, or in ſuch a nature that he need fear nothing from <hi>Men;</hi> yet he knows there is an Offended <hi>God</hi> to whom he hath a ſad and a fearful Reckoning to make; a God too <hi>Juſt</hi> to be Bribed, too <hi>Mighty</hi> to be Over-awed, too <hi>Wiſe</hi> to be Impoſed upon. And is not <hi>the Man,</hi> think you, under ſuch Reflections as theſe likely
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:63712:43"/>to live a very <hi>Comfortable life?</hi> Ah, none knows the <hi>Bitterneſs</hi> of them but himſelf that feels them. To the Judgment of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers he perhaps appears a very happy Man, he hath the World at his beck, all things ſeem to conſpire to make him a great <hi>Example</hi> of <hi>Proſperity;</hi> we admire, we appland his Condition. But ah, we know not how ſad a heart he often carries under this fair Out-ſide: we know not with what ſudden Damps his Spirit is often ſtruck, even in the heighth of his Revel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. We know not how unquiet, how broken his ſleeps are, how oft he ſtarts and looks pale; when the Wife that lies by his ſide underſtands not what the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter is with him.</p>
               <p>He doth indeed endeavour all he can to ſtifle his Cares, and to ſtop the mouth of his Conſcience. He thinks to <hi>divert</hi> it with <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> or to <hi>flatter</hi> it with little <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phiſtries,</hi> or to <hi>drown</hi> it with <hi>Rivers</hi> of <hi>Wine,</hi> or to <hi>calm</hi> it with <hi>ſoft</hi> and <hi>gentle Airs.</hi> And he is indeed ſometimes ſo ſucceſsful in theſe Arts as for a while to lay it aſleep. But alas! this is no laſting Peace, the leaſt thing awakens it, even the ſound of a <hi>Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing-Bell,</hi> or a <hi>clap</hi> of <hi>Thunder;</hi> nay, a Frightful <hi>Dream,</hi> or a <hi>Melancholy Story</hi> hath the power to do it, and then the poor Man returns to his Torment.</p>
               <pb n="80" facs="tcp:63712:44"/>
               <p>And now judge you whether the Honeſt and Vertuous Man that is free from all theſe Agonies, that is at Peace with <hi>God,</hi> and at Peace with his own <hi>Conſcience;</hi> that appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hends nothing terrible from the <hi>one,</hi> nor feels any thing troubleſome from the <hi>other,</hi> but is ſafe from <hi>Himſelf</hi> and from all the <hi>world</hi> in his own Innocence: Judge, I ſay whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch a one hath not laid to himſelf <hi>better</hi> and <hi>ſurer Foundations</hi> for <hi>Pleaſures</hi> and a happy Life, than the Man that by indulging his <hi>Luſts</hi> and <hi>Vices,</hi> only breeds up a <hi>Snake</hi> in his <hi>Boſom,</hi> which will not ceaſe to <hi>Sting</hi> and <hi>Gall</hi> him beyond what a Tongue is able to expreſs, or a <hi>witty Cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> to invent.</p>
               <p>Fourthly and laſtly, Beſides the benefits of <hi>Religion</hi> for <hi>removing</hi> the <hi>hinderances</hi> of our <hi>Pleaſures;</hi> it alſo adds to Humane Life a world of <hi>Pleaſures</hi> of its own, which vicious men are utterly unacquainted with.</p>
               <p>And theſe are of ſo excellent a kind, ſo delicious, ſo enraviſhing, that the higheſt gratifications of ſenſe, are not comparable to them. Never till we come to be hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Religious do we underſtand what <hi>true Pleaſure</hi> is. That which ariſeth from the grateful motions that are made in our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſes, is but a <hi>faint ſhadow,</hi> a <hi>mere dream</hi> of it. Then do we begin to enjoy
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:63712:44"/>
                  <hi>true Pleaſures</hi> indeed when our Higheſt and Divineſt Faculties, which were whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laid aſleep while we lived the Life of Senſe, begin to be awakened, and to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe themſelves upon their proper objects; when we become acquainted with God, and the Infinite Abyſs of <hi>Good</hi> that is in him; when our hearts are made ſenſible of the great Love and Good-will he bears us; and in that Senſe are powerfully carried out in Joy and Love, and Deſire after him: When we feel the <hi>Divine Nature</hi> daily more and more diſplayed in our Souls, ſhewing forth it ſelf in the bleſſed Fruits of Charity, and Peaceableneſs, and Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and Humility, and Purity, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, and all the other Graces of the Holy Spirit. It is not poſſible but that ſuch a Life as this muſt needs be a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of inexpreſſible Joy to him that leads it, and fill the Soul with tranſcendently greater Content than any thing upon Earth can poſſibly do: For this is the Life of God, this is the Life of the Bleſſed Angels above, this is the Life that is moſt of all agreeable to our own Natures. While we live thus, things are with us as they ſhould be; our Souls are in their natural Poſture, in that ſtate they were framed and deſigned to live in: whereas the Life of Sin is a ſtate of Diſorder and Confuſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; a perpetual violence and force upon
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:63712:45"/>our Natures. While we live thus, we enjoy the <hi>Pleaſures</hi> of <hi>Men,</hi> whereas be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when we were governed by Senſe, we could pretend to no other ſatisfactions but what the <hi>Brutes</hi> have as well as we. In this ſtate of Life we gratifie our <hi>Higheſt</hi> and <hi>Nobleſt</hi> Powers, the intellectual Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites of our Souls; which as they are infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely capacious, ſo have they an infinite good to fill them: whereas in the ſenſual Life, the <hi>meaneſt,</hi> the <hi>dulleſt,</hi> and the <hi>moſt contracted</hi> Faculties of our Souls were on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provided for.</p>
               <p>But what need I carry you out into theſe <hi>Speculations,</hi> when your own <hi>ſenſe</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience</hi> will aſcertain you in this matter above a thouſand Arguments. Do but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly ſet your ſelves to <hi>ſerve God,</hi> if you have yet never done it, do but once try what it is to live up to the Precepts of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and <hi>Veriue,</hi> and <hi>Religion;</hi> and I dare confidently pronounce that you will in <hi>one mouth</hi> find more <hi>Joy,</hi> more <hi>Peace,</hi> more <hi>Content,</hi> to ariſe in your ſpirits, from the ſenſe that you have reſiſted the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Evil, and done what was your duty to do, than in <hi>many years</hi> ſpent in Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and a Licentious courſe of living. I doubt not in the leaſt, but that after you have once <hi>ſeen</hi> and <hi>taſted how gracious the Lord is,</hi> how good all his ways are, but you will proclaim to all the World, that
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:63712:45"/>
                  <hi>One day ſpent in his Courts is better than a thouſand:</hi> Nay, you will be ready to cry out with the <hi>Roman Orator</hi> (if it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to quote the Teſtimony of a <hi>Heathen,</hi> after that of the <hi>Divine</hi> Pſalmiſt) that <hi>One day lived according to the Precepts of Vertue is to be preferred before an Immortality of Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You will then alter all your ſentiments of things, and wonder that you ſhould have been ſo ſtrangely abuſed by falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentations of Vertue and Vice. You will then ſee that Religion is quite another thing than it appeared to you before you became acquainted with it. Inſtead of that grim, ſowre, unpleaſant Countenance in which you heretofore painted her to your ſelf, you will then diſcover nothing in her but what is infinitely Lovely and Charming. Thoſe very Actions of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which you now cannot think upon with Patience, they ſeem ſo harſh and unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, you will then find to be accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a wonderful Delight. You will not then complain of the <hi>narrowneſs</hi> of the <hi>Bounds,</hi> or the <hi>ſcantineſs</hi> of the <hi>Meaſures</hi> that it hath confined your deſires to; for you will then find, that you have hereby gained an entrance into a far greater and more perfect <hi>Liberty.</hi> How ungentilely, how much againſt the <hi>grain</hi> of <hi>Nature</hi> ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it now looks to <hi>forgive</hi> an <hi>Injury,</hi> or
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:63712:46"/>an <hi>Affront;</hi> you will then find it to be as far more eaſie, ſo far more ſweet than to revenge one. You will no longer think works of <hi>Charity</hi> burdenſome or expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; or that to do good Offices to every one is an employment too mean for you; for you will then experience that there is no ſenſuality like that of <hi>doing Good,</hi> and that it is a greater pleaſure to <hi>do</hi> a kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs than to <hi>riceive</hi> one. How will you chide your ſelf for having been ſo averſe to <hi>Prayer</hi> and other <hi>devout Exerciſes,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting them as tireſome unſavoury things; when you begin to feel the deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Reliſhes they leave upon your Spirit? You will then confeſs that no Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is half ſo agreeable as that which we enjoy with God Almighty in Prayer; no Cordial ſo reviving as heartily to pour out our Souls unto him. And then to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with his <hi>Mercies,</hi> to praiſe and give thanks to him for his Benefits, what is it but a very <hi>Heaven</hi> upon <hi>Earth,</hi> an antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of the Joys of Eternity? Nay, you will not be without your pleaſures even in the very <hi>entrance</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> then when you exerciſe acts of <hi>Repentance,</hi> when you <hi>mourn</hi> and <hi>afflict</hi> your ſelf for your ſins, which ſeems the frightfulleſt thing in all Religion. For ſuch is the nature of that holy ſorrow, that you would not for all the World be without it, and you will
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:63712:46"/>find far greater Contentment and Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction in <hi>grieving</hi> for your <hi>Offences,</hi> than ever you did receive from the <hi>Committing</hi> them.</p>
               <p>But, O the ineffable Pleaſures that do continually ſpring up in the heart of a good Man, from the ſnſe of God's Love, and the hope of his Favour, and the fair proſpect he hath of the Joy and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the other World! How pleaſing, how tranſporting will the thought of theſe things be to you! To think that you are one of thoſe happy Souls that are of an Enemy become the Friend of God, that your ways pleaſe him, and that you are not only <hi>Pardoned,</hi> but <hi>Accepted</hi> and <hi>Belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved</hi> by him? to think that you a <hi>poor Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> who were of your ſelf nothing, and by your ſins had made your ſelf far worſe than nothing, are yet by the goodneſs of your Saviour become ſo <hi>conſiderable</hi> a <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> as to be able to give delight to the King of the World, and to <hi>cauſe joy in Heaven among the Bleſſed Angels by your Repentance:</hi> to think that God charges his Providence with you, takes care of all your Concerns, hears all your Prayers, provides all things needful for you, and that he will in his good time take you up unto himſelf, to live everlaſtingly in his Preſence, to be partaker of his Glories, to be raviſhed with his Love, to be acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:63712:47"/>with his Counſels, to know and be known by <hi>Angels, Archangels,</hi> and <hi>Sera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phims;</hi> to enjoy a Converſation with <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets Apostles,</hi> and <hi>Martyrs,</hi> and all the <hi>Raiſed</hi> and <hi>Glorified Spirits</hi> of Brave <hi>Men;</hi> and with all theſe to ſpend a happy and a rapturous Eternity, in Adoring, in Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, in Praiſing God for the Infiniteneſs of his Wiſdom, and the Miracles of his Mercy and Goodneſs to all his Creatures. Can there be any <hi>Pleaſure</hi> like this? Can any thing in the World put you into ſuch an <hi>Ecstaſie</hi> of <hi>Joy</hi> as the very <hi>thought</hi> of theſe things? With what a mighty ſcorn and contempt will you in the ſenſe of them look down upon all the little Gauderies and ſickly Satisfactions that the Men of this World keep ſuch a ſtir about? How emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and evanid, how flat and unſavoury will the beſt Pleaſures on Earth appear to you in compariſon of theſe Divine Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentments? You will perpetually rejoyce, you will ſing Praiſes to your Saviour, you will bleſs they day that ever you became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him; you will confeſs him to be the only maſter of Pleaſure in the World, and that you never knew what it was to be an <hi>Epicure</hi> indeed, till you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi>

               <p>No Man had ever greater Opportunities of Trying all the Ways wherein Men ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſeek for Contentment, than he had; and no Man did ever more induſtriouſly

               <p>He apply'd his Mind to Political Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and other ſorts of Knowledge; and his Attainments in that kind were greater than of any that were before him: Yet he experienced at laſt,<note place="margin">Ver. 18.</note> that <hi>in Wiſdom was much Grief; and he that increaſeth Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, increaſeth Sorrow.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He <hi>proved his Heart</hi> (as he tells us) <hi>with Mirth and Wine,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Chap. 2. Ver. 1, 3.</note> and all ſorts of Senſual Pleaſures, to find if theſe were good for the Sons of Men: And yet ſo far was he from his deſir'd Satisfaction in theſe things, that he was forced to <hi>ſay of Laughter,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 2.</note> 
                  <hi>that it was mad; and of Mirth, What Good doth it?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He turned himſelf to Works of Pomp and Magnificence: He built him ſtately <hi>Houſes,</hi> and made him <hi>Gardens,</hi> and <hi>Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yards,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 4.</note> and <hi>Orchards,</hi> and <hi>Fountains.</hi> He increaſed his Poſſeſſions,<note place="margin">Ver. 8.</note> and <hi>gathered Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:63712:49"/>and Gold, and the precious Treaſures of Kings, and of the Provinces.</hi> He got him a vaſt Retinue, and kept the moſt ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Court that ever any Prince of that Country did: Yet (as he tells us) when he came to <hi>look upon all the Works that his hands had wrought,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ver. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>and on the Labour that he had laboured to do, behold all was Vanity and Vexation of Spirit, and there was no Profit under the Sun.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But wherein then is there any Profit, if not in theſe things? What is that Good that the Sons of Men are to apply them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to, in order to their living as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably as the ſtate of things here will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low? This Queſtion (after an Intimation of the Uncertainty and Perplexedneſs of all Humane Events; but withall, of the Exactneſs of the Providence of God, <hi>who hath made every thing beautiful in its Seaſon</hi>) he thus reſolves in the Words of the Text, <hi>I know</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that there is no good in them, but for a Man to rejoice and do good in his Life.</hi> That is to ſay,</p>
               <p>I have found by long Experience, that all the Happineſs that is to be had in the Good Things of this Life doth ariſe from theſe two Things, <hi>Rejoicing</hi> in the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of them, and <hi>Doing Good</hi> to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers with them while we live. Take away theſe two Uſes, and there is no good in them.</p>
               <pb n="91" facs="tcp:63712:49"/>
               <p>Or, if you pleaſe, we may interpret the firſt part of his Propoſition, not of <hi>Things,</hi> but of <hi>Men,</hi> thus; <hi>I know there is no good in them; i. e.</hi> I am convinced that there is nothing ſo good for the Sons of Men; or, nothing that more contributes to their Happineſs in this World, than that <hi>every Man ſhould rejoice and do good in his Life.</hi> And to this purpoſe the Words are render'd by ſeveral Interpreters: But it is no matter which of the Senſes we pitch upon, ſince in effect they come both to one thing.</p>
               <p>Two Things then <hi>Solomon</hi> here recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends to every one that would live com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortably in this World; <hi>Rejoicing,</hi> and <hi>Doing Good:</hi> And I do not know what can be more proper and ſeaſonable to be recommended and inſiſted on to you at this time, and on this occaſion, than theſe two things; for the putting <hi>them</hi> in pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice makes up the whole Deſign of this Meeting.</p>
               <p>We are here ſo many Brethren met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to <hi>Rejoice,</hi> and to <hi>do Good:</hi> To <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice</hi> together in the Senſe and Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment of God's Mercies and Bleſſings to us, and in the Enjoyment of Society one with another: And to <hi>do Good,</hi> not only by increaſing our Friendſhip and mutual Correſpondence, but by joining together in a chearful Contribution to thoſe our Country-men that need our Charity. To
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:63712:50"/>entertain you therefore upon theſe two Points ſeems to be my proper Buſineſs.</p>
               <p>But in treating of them, I ſhall make bold to invert the Order in which they are put in the Text, and ſhall firſt ſpeak of <hi>do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Good,</hi> though it be laſt named; and ſhall afterwards treat of <hi>Rejoicing.</hi> The truth is, <hi>Doing Good</hi> in the Order of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture goes before <hi>Rejoicing,</hi> for it is the Foundation of it. There can be no true Joy in the Poſſeſſion or Uſe of any World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Bleſſings, unleſs we can ſatisfie our ſelves we have done ſome <hi>Good</hi> with them. It is the <hi>doing Good</hi> that ſanctifies our other Enjoyments, and makes them Matter of <hi>Rejoicing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in treating of this Argument, I ſhall briefly endeavour theſe Three Things.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>Firſt, I ſhall earneſtly recommend to you the Practice of <hi>doing Good,</hi> upon ſeveral Conſiderations.</item>
                  <item>Secondly, I ſhall repreſent the Practicable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it, by ſhewing the ſeveral Ways which every Perſon (though in the meaneſt Circumſtances) is capable of <hi>doing Good.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>Thirdly, I ſhall make two or three In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences, by way of Application.</item>
               </list>
               <p>I begin with the Firſt Thing, Seriouſly to recommend the Practice of <hi>doing Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But where ſhall I begin to ſpeak, either of the Obligations that lie upon us, or of
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:63712:50"/>the Benefits and Advantages that do accrue to us by <hi>doing Good in our Lives?</hi> Or ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving begun, where ſhall I make an end? The Subject is ſo copious, that the Study of a whole Life cannot exhauſt it. The more we conſider it, ſtill the more and the weightier Arguments will preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to us to engage us in the practice of it; and the more we practiſe it, ſtill the more ſhall we <hi>deſire</hi> ſo to do, and the more happy and bleſſed ſhall we find our ſelves to be.</p>
               <p>For, to <hi>do Good</hi> is nothing elſe but to act according to the Frame and Make of our Beings. It is to gratifie thoſe Inclinations and Appetites that are moſt ſtrongly root<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our Natures; ſuch as Love and Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Affection, Pity and Compaſſion, a Deſire of Friends, and a Propenſity to knot our ſelves into Companies and Societies. What are all theſe but ſo many <hi>Stimuli,</hi> ſo many powerful Incitements of Nature to put us upon doing good Offices one to another?</p>
               <p>To <hi>do Good</hi> is the End of all thoſe Acqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, of all thoſe Talents, of all thoſe Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and Advantages that God has bleſs'd us with; it is the proper Uſe we are to put them to. If we do not employ them this way, we are ſo far from being <hi>better</hi> for them, that we are much <hi>worſe.</hi> What will ſignifie our Wit and good Humour, our Strength of Reaſon and Memory, our Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Knowledge, our Skill in Arts, and
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:63712:51"/>Dexterity in managing Buſineſs, our Wealth and Greatneſs, our Reputation and Intereſt in the World; I ſay, what will all theſe ſignifie, if they do not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us more Uſeful and Beneficial to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers? That which ſets the price and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue upon every worldly bleſſing, is the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity it affords us of <hi>doing Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To <hi>do Good</hi> ſeems to be the foundation of all the Laws of Nature, the ſupreme Univerſal Law; it is that by which the World is ſupported, and take that away, all would preſently fall into confuſion. And perhaps if it were particularly exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>min'd, it would be found that all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Natural Laws may be reduced to this, and are ultimately to be reſolv'd into it. It is a queſtion whether there be any na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Standard whereby we can meaſure the Vertue or the Viciouſueſs of any Action, but the Influence that it hath to promote or hinder the <hi>doing of Good.</hi> This is that that ſeems to ſtamp Vertue and Vice.</p>
               <p>To <hi>do Good</hi> is the great Work for the ſake of which we were ſent into the World, and no Man lives farther to any purpoſe than as he is an Inſtrument of doing Good. Be our Lives otherwiſe never ſo buſie and full of action, yet if others receive no be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit by them, we cannot give our ſelves any tolerable account of our time, we have in effect liv'd idly and done nothing.</p>
               <pb n="95" facs="tcp:63712:51"/>
               <p>To <hi>do Good</hi> is that which of all other ſervices is moſt acceptable to God, it is that which he hath laid the greateſt ſtreſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Scripture, it is that which he hath with the moſt earneſt and affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate perſuaſives, with the ſtrongeſt argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, with the greateſt promiſes, and with the moſt dreadful threatnings en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forc'd upon us. It is that which he hath choſen before all Sacrifices and all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous worſhip, ſtrictly ſo called, to be ſerv'd with. It is that which he hath appoint-for the great Expreſſion both of our Thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs for his Benefits, and of our Love and Devotion to him. Laſtly, it is that which <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets make the Sum of the Old Law, and Chriſt and his Apoſtles the Sum of the New.</p>
               <p>And very great Reaſon there is for it; for to <hi>do Good</hi> is to become moſt like to God. It is that which of all other Qualities gives us the greateſt reſemblance of his Nature and Perfections,<note place="margin">1 Job. 4.2.</note> for perfect Love and Goodneſs is the very Nature of God, and the Root of all his other Attributes; and there was never any Action done, any work wrought by him throughout the vaſt tracts of infinite ſpace, from the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of time to this Moment, but was an Expreſſion of his Love, and an inſtance of <hi>doing Good,</hi> (nay I doubt not to ſay, the moſt ſevere acts of his Juſtice and Venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="96" facs="tcp:63712:52"/>have all been ſuch) And therefore with great reaſon hath our bleſſed Lord told us,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.44, 45.</note> that the way to become the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of our Heavenly Father is to do Good to all, with the ſame Freedom and Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſervedneſs that God makes his Sun to ſhine upon the World.</p>
               <p>And of this our Bleſſed Saviour himſelf was the moſt illuſtrious Example that ever appeared in the World, ſo that to <hi>do Good</hi> is that which doth moſt truly and perfectly render us the Diſciples and Followers of Jeſus, makes us really be what we pretend we are. His whole Life (as the Goſpel tells us) was but a continual going about doing Good. The great Deſign of his Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming from Heaven, and of all that he ſpoke, and of all that he did, and of all that he ſuffer'd upon Earth, was the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiting of others. And he hath left it as the great diſtinguiſhing Badge and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter whereby his Diſciples ſhould be known from other Men, that they ſhould <hi>love one another even as he had lov'd them,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Joh. 13.34, 35.</note> that is (as his Apoſtle expounds him) they ſhould love and do Good to that degree as <hi>to lay down their lives for their brethren.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Joh. 3.16.</note>
               </p>
               <p>But to <hi>do Good</hi> is not only our greateſt Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty but our greateſt Intereſt and Advantage, which is that that <hi>Solomon</hi> chiefly refers to in the Text. It is certain that no Man can take a more Effectual way to render his Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="97" facs="tcp:63712:52"/>in the world Happy and Comfortable to him (according to the ordinary courſe and event of things) in what Condition or Circumſtances ſoever he is placed, than to do all the Good he can in his life; ſo that though a man that lays out himſelf in this way, ſeems only to reſpect the good of other people, yet in true reckoning he moſt conſults his own profit.</p>
               <p>For to <hi>do Good</hi> is the natural way to raiſe us Friends, who ſhall be oblig'd to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute their Endeavours to the furthering our honeſt deſigns; to the upholding and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing us in our Proſperity, and to the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couring and relieving us when we are in any evil Circumſtances. Such is the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and the Conſtitution of this World, that no man can ſubſiſt of himſelf, but ſtands in continual need of others, both for their comfortable Society and their neceſſary Aſſiſtance in his Affairs. Now of all men living the Good man who maketh it his Buſineſs to oblige all about him is moſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be the beſt befriended.</p>
               <p>To <hi>do Good</hi> is the trueſt way to procure to a man's ſelf a Good name and Reputation in the World, which as it is a thing deſirable upon many accounts, ſo it is a ſingular Advantage to a man for the carrying on his ſecular deſigns. Nay to <hi>do good</hi> is to Embalm a man's name and to tranſmit it with a grateful Odour to Poſterity.
<pb n="98" facs="tcp:63712:53"/>
                  <hi>The memory of a good man ſhall be bleſſed.</hi>

               <p>But which is a great deal more than all this, to <hi>do Good</hi> is the moſt certain effectual means to procure the bleſſing of God upon our endeavours, and to entitle our ſelves to his more eſpecial Care and Providence and Protection: So that let what will come; in all circumſtances and conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons the good man has the greateſt aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that all things ſhall at leaſt be tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably well with him, and that he ſhall never be miſerable. <hi>Truſt in the Lord</hi> (ſaith <hi>David</hi>) <hi>and be doing good,</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Nay farther, to <hi>do Good</hi> is to entail a bleſſing upon our Children after us.<note place="margin">

               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, to conclude this point, To <hi>do Good</hi> (beſides all theſe advantages that attend it) is moſt to conſult our own Peace, and
<pb n="99" facs="tcp:63712:53"/>to make the beſt proviſion poſſible for our pleaſure and delight. Charity (as Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> uſed to ſay) is really a piece of Senſuality. And <hi>Epicurus</hi> himſelf the great Maſter of Voluptuouſneſs would confeſs that it was not only more Brave but more Pleaſant to do Kindneſſes than to receive them. And certainly every good man will find it ſo, for as the exerciſe of Charity and Beneficence is as truly a gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of our Natural Inclinations and Appetites as any other action or thing that cauſeth pleaſure to us: So is it alſo a gratification of thoſe Appetites which are the higheſt and the nobleſt we have. Now by how much the appetite that is gratifi'd is more noble and divine; by ſo much muſt the delight that ariſeth from that gratification be more exquiſite. So that it was no very great Hyperbole of our Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Poet when he ſaid that</p>
               <q>
                  <l>—All joys go leſs</l>
                  <l>Than that one joy of doing kindneſſes</l>
               </q>
               <p>And which is farther to be conſidered, it is not with this pleaſure as it is with moſt others that vaniſh with the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, nay often leave bitterneſs and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy upon the Mind after they are gone off. For to <hi>do Good</hi> is a permanent pleaſure, a pleaſure that will laſt as long
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:63712:54"/>as our lives. The memory of our good actions will always be accompanied with Delight and Satisfaction; when all our other paſt Enjoyments prove matters of anguiſh and torment to us upon our reflexions on them, theſe will be a refreſhment; and the nearer we approach to death, ſtill the more comfort we ſhall find in them. Would we therefore treaſure up to our ſelves a ſtock of laſting peace and joy to ſupport us in all conditions of our life, and and ſo make our paſſage eaſie at our death, let us do all the good we can.</p>
               <p>I think I have ſaid enough to convince any one of the truth of <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Propoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that <hi>there is nothing better for a man,</hi> nothing that more concerns him either in point of duty or happineſs <hi>than to do good in his life.</hi> Much more might be ſaid, and what hath been ſaid might have been ſaid with more advantage, and greater evidence, if it had been fit to inſiſt upon every parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular: but I will purſue this Argument no farther, but proceed to the ſecond general point I propoſed, which is to ſet before you the practicabieneſs of this great duty, by ſhewing the ſeveral ways which every perſon though in the meaneſt Circumſtances is capable of doing Good.</p>
               <p>A great many there are that are as ſtrongly convinced as may be that 'tis both their Intereſt and duty to be doing Good in their
<pb n="101" facs="tcp:63712:54"/>lives, but they complain that it is not in their power, they have not any Means or Opportunities for it, and they bemoan themſelves ſadly upon this account, as thinking their lives uſeleſs, becauſe they have not thoſe viſible Capacities of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſerviceable to the world that others have.</p>
               <p>To ſuch as theſe let me ſay this in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral: There is no condition in the world ſo mean and deſpicable, but yields us Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities of doing Good. There is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Old nor Young, Man nor Woman, Rich nor Poor, High nor Low, Learned nor Unlearned, but in their Sphere, by a good husbandry of thoſe Talents that God has intruſted to their care and management they may be very uſeful to others, and prove inſtruments of much good in their generations.</p>
               <p>This truth St. <hi>Paul</hi> moſt elegantly ſets forth in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12. where he compares the Society of Chriſtians to a Natural body. There he ſhews that as in the Natural body there are many members, and all thoſe members have not the ſame dignity and honour, nor the ſame uſe or office: and yet every member (even the meaneſt) hath its particular uſe by which it doth real ſervice to the body; nay ſo uſeful it is that the body cannot be without it: ſo it is with the Church of Chriſt, and with
<pb n="102" facs="tcp:63712:55"/>every Body Politick. There is a neceſſity both in the Church and in the State, that there ſhould be variety of functions and callings, and degrees and conditions. There muſt be ſome to govern, and ſome to be governed; there muſt be ſome more conſpicuous, ſome more obſcure; ſome whoſe gifts and endowments lie this way, and ſome whoſe Talents lie in another way; and yet there is not one of theſe but in his degree and ſtation, either is or may be as uſeful as any that belong to the Society. <hi>So that the eye cannot ſay to the hand</hi> (as our Apoſtle there expreſſeth it) <hi>I have no need of thee.</hi> Nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you, nay more, <hi>thoſe members of the body</hi> (as he continues) <hi>that ſeem to be moſt feeble are yet very neceſſary.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To reduce the Apoſtle's notion to its par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars, or to ſhew in how many reſpects every individual perſon that is a Member of a Society is neceſſary to the publick, and either doth or may ſerve the Weal of it, and ſo do Good in his life, is a task too great for me to undertake at this time, let it ſuffice at the preſent to propoſe to you theſe general heads.</p>
               <p>Firſt of all, None can want opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of doing Good that is in a capacity of performing any acts of Mercy or Charity, ſtriſtly ſo called, whether that Charity be
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:63712:55"/>ſhew'd to the Bodies or Souls of men. Now the inſtances and expreſſions of this way of doing good are infinite, as infinite as are the wants and neceſſities of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
               <p>To the Bodies of men we do good when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we contribute to the relieving and ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them of the outward preſſures and wants, and neceſſities they lie under: Such as Sickneſs, Pain, Poverty, Hunger, Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, Debts, Impriſonment, or any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther outward affliction that falls upon them; whether that eaſe and relief be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by our purſe, or by our counſel and advice, or by our labour and pains.</p>
               <p>And ſure ſome one of theſe three things there is none ſo mean or incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable in the World, but it is in his power to benefit his poor Neighbour with.</p>
               <p>To the Souls of men we do good, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever by our diſcourſes or other endeavours we make men better or wiſer; when we inſtruct the ignorant, when we ſatisfie the doubtful, when we reduce thoſe that are miſled by errour, when we eſtabliſh the weak, when we reprove thoſe that do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs; in a word, all our attempts and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours in what way ſoever to reclaim men from vice, and to bring them to wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and ſobriety is a Charity to their Souls; and whether our deſigns ſucceed or
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:63712:56"/>not, we ſhall be rewarded as thoſe that have done good in the world.</p>
               <p>Secondly, All the acts of Beneficence and kindneſs, nay even of Civility and good Nature, are to be accounted among the inſtances of doing good. A man doth Good not only by acts of Charity properly ſo called, but by every courteſie that he doth to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; He doth good by ſhewing his reſpect and good-will to all about him, by recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciling differences among neighbours, and promoting peace, friendſhip and ſociety as much as he can; by being Generous and Liberal and Hoſpitable according to his a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility; by forgiving injuries, and if it be poſſible making friends of thoſe that did them; by being eaſie of acceſs, and ſweet and obliging in his carriage; by complying with the infirmities of thoſe he converſeth with, and in a word, by contributing any way to make the lives of others more eaſie and comfortable to them.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, A man alſo doth good when he makes uſe of that acquaintance or friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or intereſt, that he hath with others to ſtir them up to the doing of that good which he by the narrowneſs of his condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or for want of Opportunity cannot do himſelf. This is a very conſiderable inſtance of doing good how ſlight ſoever it may ſeem; the man that exerciſes himſelf this way is doubly a benefactor; for he is not
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:63712:56"/>only an inſtrument of good to the perſon or perſons for whom he beg'd the kindneſs or the charity; but he does alſo a real kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the man himſelf whom he puts up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the benefaction, for God will not leſs reward his Good-will for being excited by another.</p>
               <p>Fourthly, Another way to do good is to be careful and diligent, and conſcienti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in the diſcharge of all thoſe Publick Offices which we are called upon to exce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute in the place where we live. How bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenſome ſoever theſe be, and how much ſoever of our time they rob us of, yet God by calling us to them, hath put a <hi>prize into our hands,</hi> (as the Wiſe man ſpeaks) to do much good, <hi>if we have hearts to make uſe thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fifthly, We do good when being in a private Capacity we ſo carry our ſelves in all the Relations in which we ſtand as the nature of the Relation requireth. As for inſtance, when being Subjects we conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiouſly obey the Laws of the Kingdom, and ſubmit to our Governours, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote what we can the publick Peace both of Church and State. When being Maſters of Families we take care of thoſe under our Charge, making ſufficient proviſion both for their Souls and Bodies. When being Husbands or Wives we diſcharge faithfully all the Conjugal duties: When being Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:63712:57"/>we love our Children, and <hi>bring them up in the fear and nurture of the Lord.</hi> When being Children <hi>we obey our Parents in all things.</hi> When being Servants <hi>we do our work in ſingleneſs of heart, not as men-pleaſers but as thoſe that account they have a Maſter in Heaven.</hi> When having contracted friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips we are ſecret and faithful, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent in the maintaining and preſerving of them; and ſo proportionably in all the other relations that we ſtand in. All theſe things though they appear little, yet are they in their degree a real good and benefit to Mankind, and ſo neceſſary that there is no living tolerably without them.</p>
               <p>Sixthly, We alſo do good by an honeſt and a diligent purſuit of our calling and employment There is no Art or Trade that we are bred to, but if it be a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful one, it may be of great uſe to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and by well minding it, and fairly managing it we may render our ſelves ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry profitable members of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth.</p>
               <p>Seventhly and Laſtly, We may do a great deal of good by our good Examples, by being to others Patterns of Piety and Prudence, of Diligence and Induſtry, of Peaceableneſs and Loyalty, of Humility and Meekneſs and Temperance. In a word, every man that will make himſelf Eminent in any Vertue will be a Light to
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:63712:57"/>the World, his life will be a conſtant Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, and he will often prove as effectual a Benefactor to thoſe about him by his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample as others are by their Counſels and Exhortations.</p>
               <p>And now all theſe things conſidered, who is there among us in ſuch deplorable Circumſtances that he can reaſonably pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to want ability or opportunity to <hi>do good in his life?</hi> Sure I am he muſt live in a deſert and have no Communication with mankind that cannot ſome or other of theſe ways be uſeful and beneficial to them. And thus much of our Second Head of Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>I now come, in the Third and Laſt place, to make ſome Application of what hath been ſpoken.</p>
               <p>And Firſt, Since every man is ſo highly concern'd as we have ſeen, to do Good in his life, let us all be perſuaded ſeriouſly and heartily to apply our Minds hereunto. Let us look upon it, not as a by-work, a thing to be done now and then, as there is occaſion, after our own turns are ſerved: But let us lay out our ſelves upon it, let us propoſe it to our ſelves as the great Buſineſs of our lives. Let us take all opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for it, let us contrive and manage all our affairs ſo that they may ſome way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be ſubſervient to the carrying on this great work.</p>
               <pb n="108" facs="tcp:63712:58"/>
               <p>Let this be the end of our gathering riches, and the meaſure of our expending them. To heap up riches that we may be rich, or to throw them away upon our luſts are both equally intolerable, it is the doing good with them that ſanctifies both the getting and the ſpending them.</p>
               <p>Let this be the compaſs to ſteer and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect us in our purſuit after knowledge, in our learning Arts and Sciences, in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagery of our Trades and employments; in a word, in the choice and in the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of every deſign that is propoſed to us. In all theſe things, the great enquiry is to be, what Good will they tend to? How ſhall we be rendred more uſeful to the world, if our deſigns and endavours as to theſe matters do take effect?</p>
               <p>Let this be the great rule by which we proceed in the Education of our Children and Relations, and the proviſions we make for them in the world. Let it be our firſt care to poſſeſs them with a deep ſenſe of the duty they owe to the Publick, and to furniſh them with ſuch qualities as will ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them profitable Members of it, and to put them into ſuch profeſſions and employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as may afford them fair ſcope for the exerciſe of thoſe qualities. If we thus pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for them, though we otherwiſe leave them never ſo ſmall an Eſtate, yet with the Bleſſing of God they have a good Portion.</p>
               <pb n="109" facs="tcp:63712:58"/>
               <p>Laſtly, let this deſign of doing good in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence our very Offices of Religion. When we make our applications to the Throne of Grace, let us be ſure to have the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick always in mind; and even when we pray for our ſelves, let it be with this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and reſolution, that as God in mercy beſtows upon us the Bleſſings and the Grace we pray for, we will employ them for the good of others.</p>
               <p>O that we would thus ſeriouſly concern our ſelves in doing good! O that we would once lay aſide all our little ſelfiſh deſigns, and that narrowneſs and penuriouſneſs of Spirit with which moſt of us are bound up; and with ardent Love and Charity ſet our ſelves <hi>not to ſeek his own but every man ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's good,</hi> as the Apoſtle exhorteth.<note place="margin">1 Cor. 10.24.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, if the doing good be ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary a duty as hath been repreſented, what muſt we ſay of thoſe Men that frame to themſelves Models of Chriſtianity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out putting this duty into its notion? There is a ſort of Chriſtianity which hath obtained in the world, that is made up of Faith and knowledge of the Goſpel My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteries, without any reſpect to Charity and good works. Nay have we not heard of a ſort of Chriſtianity, the very perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of which ſeems to conſiſt in the diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raging this duty of doing Good as much as is poſſible; crying it down as a heathen
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:63712:59"/>Vertue; a poor blind piece of Morality, a thing that will no way further our ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nay ſo far from that, that it often proves a hindrance to it, by taking us off from that full relyance and recumbency that we ought to have on the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Jeſus Chriſt only, in order to our Salvation.</p>
               <p>But O how contrary are theſe Doctrines to the Doctrine of Chriſt and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles! How widely different a thing do they make Chriſtianity to be from what it will appear if we take our notions of it from their Sermons and Practices! Is it poſſible that he that went about doing Good him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; made it his meat and drink, the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs and employment of his life, ſhould ſet ſo light by it in us that are his fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers?</p>
               <p>Is it poſſible that they that ſo often call upon us <hi>to do Good,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.18. 1 Pet. 4.8. 1 Cor. 13.2.13.</note> 
                  <hi>to be rich in good works, above all things to have fervent charity a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong our ſelves,</hi> telling us that all <hi>faith is nothing, all knowledge of myſteries</hi> is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, all gifts of <hi>Prophecy</hi> and <hi>Miracles</hi> are nothing, but that <hi>Charity</hi> is all in all, I ſay, is it poſſible that they ſhould think do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Good ſo inſignificant, ſo unprofitable, nay ſo dangerous a thing as theſe I ſpoke of do repreſent it?</p>
               <p>But I need not farther reprove theſe Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, becauſe I hope they find but few Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons;
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:63712:59"/>but this ſeriouſly ought to be repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved among us, <hi>viz.</hi> that we do not gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally lay that ſtreſs upon this duty we are ſpeaking of that we ought to do.</p>
               <p>Many are ready enough to acknowledge their Obligations to do Good, and count it a very commendable thing, and a work that God will bleſs them the better for, yet they are loth to make it an eſſential in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gredient of their Religion, they think they may be Religious and ſerve God without it. If they be but ſober in their lives, and juſt in their dealings, and come to Church at the uſual times, they have Religion enough to carry them to Heaven, though in the mean time they continue covetous, and hard, and uncharitable, without bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of pity and compaſſion, and make no uſe of their wealth, or their power and intereſt, or their parts and induſtry, or their other Talents committed to them, for the doing good in the World.</p>
               <p>Far be it from any Man to pretend to determine what Vertues or degrees of them are preciſely neceſſary to Salvation, and what Vertues or degrees of them a man may ſafely be without: But this is certain, that Charity and doing Good are none of thoſe that can be ſpared. The Scripture hath every where declared theſe qualities to be as neceſſary in order to our Salvation as any condition of the Goſpel. Nay if we
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:63712:60"/>will conſult St. <hi>Matth.</hi> 25. where the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the General Judgment is deſcribed, we ſhall find theſe to be the great points that at the laſt day Men ſhall be examined upon, and upon which the whole caſe of their eternal ſtate will turn. So that if we take the Scripture for our Guide, theſe Men at laſt will be found to be much miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, and to have made a very falſe judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment both of Religion and of their own condition.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, From what hath been ſaid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout doing Good, we may gather wherein that Perfection of Chriſtianity which we are to aſpire after doth conſiſt. It has been much diſputed which is the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect life, to live in the World as other Men do, and to ſerve God in following our employments, and taking care of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, and doing Good offices to our neighbours, and diſcharging all other Duties that our relation to the publick requires of us; or to retire from the World, and to quit all our ſecular concernments, and wholly to give up our ſelves to Prayer and Meditation, and thoſe other exerciſes of Religion properly ſo called.</p>
               <p>This latter kind of life is ſo magnified by the <hi>Romaniſts</hi> in compariſon of the other, that it hath engroſſed to it ſelf the name of Religious. None among them are thought worthy to be ſtiled Religious
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:63712:60"/>perſons but thoſe that Cloyſter up them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a Monaſtery. But whatever ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellence may be pretended in this courſe of life, it certainly falls much ſhort of that which is led in a publick way. He ſerves God beſt that is moſt ſerviceable to his Generation. And no Prayers or Faſts or Mortifications are near ſo acceptable a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to our Heavenly Father as to <hi>do Good in our lives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true, to keep within doors and to attend our devotions (though thoſe that are in appearance moſt abſtracted from the world, are not always the moſt devout perſons) I ſay this kind of life is the moſt eaſie and the ſafer. A man is not then expoſed ſo much to temptations; he may with leſs difficulty preſerve his innocence; but where is the praiſe of ſuch a Vertue; Vertue is then moſt glorious and ſhall be moſt rewarded, when it meets with moſt trials and oppoſitions.</p>
               <p>And as for the bravery of contemning the world and all the Pomps of it, which they ſo magnifie in this kind of life, alas it is rather an effect of puſillanimity and love of our eaſe, and a deſire to be free from cares and burthens, than of any true noble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind. If we would live to excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent purpoſe indeed; if we would ſhew true bravery of Spirit and true piety towards God, let us live as our bleſſed Lord and
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:63712:61"/>his Apoſtles did. Let us not fly Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions but overcome them; let us not ſit at home amuſing our ſelves with our pleaſing contemplations, when we may be uſeful and beneficial abroad. Let us ſo order our devotions towards God, that they may be a means of promoting our worldly buſineſs and affairs, and doing Good among men. Let us take our fit times of retirement and abſtraction, that we may the more freely converſe with God and pour out our ſouls before him; but let this be only to the end that we may appear abroad again more brisk and lively in vanquiſhing the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations that come in our way, and more prompt and readily diſpoſed to every good work: This is to imitate our Lord Jeſus, to walk as we have him for an example. This is a life more ſuitable to the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and the genius of his Religion, which is more accommodated to Cities and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Societies, than to Cloyſters and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts. And laſtly,<note place="margin">Mat. 5.16.</note> this is to walk in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to his command who hath bid us <hi>make our light ſo to ſhine before men that they may ſee our good works and glorifie our Father which is in Heaven.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But Fourthly and laſtly, If it be a thing ſo neceſſary that every man ſhould do Good in his life as hath been repreſented, then how much to be reproved are they that do no Good till their death? That live
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:63712:61"/>ſcrapingly and uncharitably and uſeleſly to the world all their lives long, and then when they come to die, think to Atone for their ſins and neglects of this kind, by ſhewing ſome extraordinary Bounty to the poor, or devoting ſome part of their E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtates to publick or pious uſes.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs this kind of proceeding doth to me ſeem juſt like the buſineſs of putting off a man's repentance to his death<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed. It is abſolutely neceſſary that a Man ſhould repent though it be never ſo late; and ſo it is that he ſhould do good: if he have done little Good in his life, he is bound as he loves his ſoul to ſhew ſome extraordinary uncommon inſtances of Charity and a Publick Spirit when he comes to die. But then it is here as it is with the long delaying of Repentance, the deferring it ſo long has robbed the man of the greateſt part of the praiſe and the comfort he might have expected from it. His Rewards in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven will be much leſs though his good deeds ſhould be accepted, but he is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely uncertain whether they will or no. It muſt be a very great act of Generoſity and Charity that can obtain a pardon for a whole life of uncharitableneſs.</p>
               <p>Let us all therefore labour and ſtudy <hi>to do Good in our lives,</hi> let us be daily gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving evidences to the World of our kind
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:63712:62"/>and charitable diſpoſition, and let not that be the firſt which is diſcovered in our laſt Will and Teſtament. If God hath bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed us with worldly goods, let us diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute them as we ſee occaſion in our life time, when every one may ſee we do it voluntarily; and not ſtay till we muſt be forced to part with them whether we will or no, for that will blaſt the credit of our good deeds both with God and man.</p>
               <p>I have ſaid enough concerning the firſt point recommended in the Text, <hi>viz. do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Good.</hi> I now come briefly to Treat of the other, that is, <hi>Rejoycing,</hi> which is equally a part of the buſineſs of this day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>There is no Good</hi> (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>in any earthly thing;</hi> or <hi>there is nothing better for any Man than to rejoyce and to do Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Rejoycing</hi> her recommended, is capable of two ſenſes, the firſt more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and more concerning us as Chriſtians, the other more particular and which more immediately concerns us as we are here met upon this occaſion.</p>
               <p>In the firſt place by <hi>Rejoycing</hi> we may take to be meant, a conſtant habit of joy and chearfulneſs, ſo that we are always contented and well pleaſed, always free
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:63712:62"/>from thoſe anxieties and diſquiets and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable reflexions that make the lives of mankind miſerable. This now is the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of <hi>Rejoycing,</hi> and it is the utmoſt degree of Happineſs that we are here capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of. It muſt be granted indeed that not many do arrive to this ſtate, but yet I doubt not but that it is a ſtate that may be attained at leaſt in a great meaſure in this world. Otherwiſe the Holy Men in Scripture, and particularly the Apoſtles of our Lord would never have recommended it to us ſo often as they have done. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce evermore,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Theſſ. 9 16. Phil. 4.4.</note> ſaith S. <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Theſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonians.</hi> And to the <hi>Philipians, Rejoyce in the Lord always, and again I ſay re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The way to attain to this happy condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion doth conſiſt chiefly in theſe three things: Firſt a great innocence and vertue, a behaving our ſelves ſo in the world that our Conſciences ſhall not reproach us. This St. <hi>Paul</hi> lays as the Foundation of <hi>Rejoycing, This</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is our rejoycing,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">2 Cor. 1.12,</note>
                  <hi>the Teſtimony of our Conſcience that in ſimpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city and godly ſincerity I have had my conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation in this world.</hi> It is in vain to think of any true ſolid Joy or Peace or Content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without a hearty Practice of all the duties of our Religion, ſo that we can ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie our ſelves of our own ſincerity before God.</p>
               <pb n="118" facs="tcp:63712:63"/>
               <p>And then ſecondly, To make us capable of this conſtant Rejoycing beſides the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of our lives there muſt go a firm and hearty perſuaſion of God's particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; a belief that he not only diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth all events that come to paſs in the World, even the moſt inconſiderable; but that the meaſure of the Diſpenſations of his Providence is infinite Wiſdom and Goodneſs and nothing elſe: ſo that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing doth or ever can happen to us in particular, or to the world in general but what is for the beſt. Now when we firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly believe this and frequently attend to it, how can we be either ſolicitous for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or diſcontented at the preſent events of things, let them fall out never ſo croſs to our deſires and expectations? This is the beſt Antidote in the world (and an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual one it is) againſt all trouble and vexation and uneaſineſs that can happen to us upon any occaſion whatſoever, to wit, the conſideration that all things are mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by an infinitely wiſe and good God, and will at laſt prove for the beſt, how unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable ſoever they appear to us at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. And this is that which the wiſe man inſinuates in the verſe before the Text, when he ſaith that <hi>God hath made every thing beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful in his ſeaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thirdly, Another requiſite both for the procuring and preſerving this continual
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:63712:63"/>chearfulneſs and rejoycing, is a frequent and fixed attention to the great rewards of the other world, which God hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to all that truly love him and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to pleaſe him. This conſideration will extreamly add to our comfort, and contribute to our Rejoycing under all the miſeries and afflictions that we can poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly fall into, namely, that whatſoever con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition we are in here we ſhall certainly in a little time be in a moſt happy and glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious one, and the worſe our circumſtances are in this life, the greater (if we be good) ſhall be our happineſs in the next,<note place="margin">2. Cor. 4.17.</note> for <hi>theſe light afflictions</hi> (as S. <hi>Pual</hi> tells us) <hi>which indure but for a moment, do work for us a far more exceeding weight of glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This then is the joy that we are to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour after in the firſt place, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly well pleas'd and contented with our preſent condition, whatever it be, and theſe are the ways to attain to it.</p>
               <p>But Secondly, There is another more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Notion of <hi>Rejoycing,</hi> and which I conceive <hi>Solomon</hi> doth chiefly intend in the words of the Text, and that is the free and comfortable enjoyment of the good things of this life that God hath bleſſed us with, in oppoſition to a pinching and penurious way of living. This I ſay ſeems to be the notion of <hi>Rejoycing</hi> that the Text ſpeaks of, as appears by the following verſe. <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi>
                  <pb n="120" facs="tcp:63712:64"/>having told us in the Text, that there is nothing better for a man than to <hi>rejoyce</hi> and <hi>do Good,</hi> he adds by way of explication of what he meant by <hi>rejoycing,</hi> theſe words, <hi>that every Man ſhould eat and drink and enjoy the good of all his labours, for it is the gift of God.</hi> And frequently in this Book of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes</hi> doth he perſuade to this kind of rejoycing. Thus in <hi>Chap.</hi> 2. <hi>ver.</hi> 24. <hi>there is nothing better for a man, than that he ſhould eat and drink, and that he ſhould make his ſoul enjoy Good in his labour, this alſo I ſaw it was from the hand of God.</hi> And in <hi>Chap.</hi> 5. <hi>ver.</hi> 18. <hi>Behold that which I have ſeen, it is good and comely for one to eat and drink, and to enjoy the good of all his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours that he taketh under the ſun all the days of his life which God giveth him, for it is his portion.</hi> And in <hi>Chap.</hi> 6. <hi>ver.</hi> 1, 2. he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſents it as a <hi>great evil that he hath ſeen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſun, and yet ſuch an evil as is common among men, that a man to whom God hath given riches, and wealth, and honour, ſo that he wanteth nothing for his ſoul of all that he deſireth, yet God giveth him not power to eat thereof, but a ſtranger eateth it, this</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is vanity and an evil diſeaſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And there is certainly great reaſon in what he ſaith. For to have a plentiful portion of the good things of this life and not to have the heart to make uſe of them for the enjoyment of our ſelves and friends;
<pb n="121" facs="tcp:63712:64"/>for the refreſhing us under the toil that this life doth expoſe us to; for the promoting Acquaintance and Society, and the render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our condition as eaſie as may be; is as unaccountable a folly as we can be guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of, and makes us really as poor and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſitous as thoſe that want bread, but only not ſo pityable.</p>
               <p>Taking now this to be the ſenſe of <hi>rejoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing</hi> in the Text, (as I believe it is) we have from hence a good warrant for this day's Meeting, for we come together to <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce</hi> in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s ſenſe, that is, <hi>to eat and drink and to enjoy the good of our labours,</hi> it being <hi>the gift of God</hi> ſo to do.</p>
               <p>And this practice of ours is not only rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable in it ſelf, but is commended to us by the example of God's people both under the Law and the Goſpel. The <hi>Jews</hi> by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of God himſelf were to meet eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry year three times at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> the Capital City of the Nation,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>See</hi> Deut. 16.</note> 
                  <hi>to feaſt and to rejoyce before the Lord,</hi> as we have it in the expreſs words of <hi>Moſes.</hi> And the Chriſtians for near 200 years after our Saviours had their <hi>Agapae,</hi> their Feaſts of charity, wherein they met together both poor and rich to enjoy and make mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one with another. It is true theſe Feaſts were at length left off by common con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, becauſe there grew abuſes in them; they became occaſions of Luxury and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; and ſo matters of ſcandal to our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:63712:65"/>But this was not an ill reflexion upon the thing it ſelf, which was innocent and commendable, but upon the abuſe of the thing. A good and laudable inſtitution was perverted to evil purpoſes. However this very conſideration ought to make us very careful of our carriage and behaviour in theſe our Meetings, leſt we fall under the ſame inconveniencies; which that we may prevent, Two things are eſpecially needful to be taken care of by us.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That we do not exceed the bounds of <hi>rejoycing</hi> preſcribed to Chriſtians, that is, that we avoid all exceſs, and uſe the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of God, ſoberly and temperately, ſo as to give offence to none, nor to <hi>make proviſion for the fleſh to fulfil the lusts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Secondly, That we take care to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form and make good the ends and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns of theſe <hi>Feaſts</hi> of <hi>rejoycing;</hi> which ends, if we will take our meaſures from thoſe Laws that God gave to his own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in the Old Teſtament, and which the modern <hi>Jews</hi> themſelves in their Commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taries take notice of; and which are ſo rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable in themſelves that without any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority they do recommend themſelves to us, are theſe four following.</p>
               <p>Firſt, That we Rejoyce before the Lord, that is, that we make our humble acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments and return our due praiſes and
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:63712:65"/>thanks to him for all the good things he hath bleſſed us with in our lives, confeſſing that all we have is from his free bounty and goodneſs, and that our Meeting toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is to praiſe his name upon that account. And this was the thing that was meant by thoſe ſolemn Sacrifices that the <hi>Jews</hi> were bound to offer at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> at their Annual Feaſts.</p>
               <p>The ſecond end of theſe Feaſts is to take occaſion from hence to learn our duty, to be inſtructed in all the branches of that obedience we owe unto God. For as <hi>Maimonides</hi> obſerves, that was one of the principal reaſons of God's calling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether all the people of the <hi>Jews</hi> to appear at the Feaſt of Tabernacles, to wit, that they might hear the Law read unto them; and this deſign is I ſuppoſe purſued by us in our chuſing this Place to Aſſemble in.</p>
               <p>A third end of theſe Feaſts (as the ſame <hi>Maimonides</hi> tells us) and is manifeſt from Scripture is to promote acquaintance and Friendſhip, and brotherly love one with another. And this is a very noble end, and ſerves many excellent purpoſes, and nothing can be beyond it except,</p>
               <p>The fourth and laſt end of theſe Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, which is to <hi>do Good;</hi> to exerciſe our Charity towards our poor indigent Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. No man at the Solemn Feaſts of
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:63712:66"/>the <hi>Jews was to appear before the Lord empty;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Exod. 23.15.</note> He was to bring his offering not only to God by way of recognition and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgement to him: but for the poor alſo that they might rejoyce as well as he. This is well obſerved by <hi>Maimonides</hi> from <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.14. where it is thus ſaid, <hi>Thou ſhalt rejoyce in thy feaſt, thou and thy ſon, and thy daughter, thy man-ſervant and thy maid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant, the Levite and the ſtranger, the fatherleſs and the widow that are within thy gates.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This then is the great end of our Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, that not only we, but the Fatherleſs and the widow; all of our Country, that need our Charity, may <hi>rejoyce</hi> with us and for us. And this is that which <hi>Solomon</hi> joyns with <hi>rejoycing</hi> in the Text, <hi>There is no good in them but for a man to rejoyce and do Good:</hi> and what that Man who by the ſentence of God was declared the wiſeſt of all men hath thus joyned together, let none of us preſume to put aſunder. Theſe are the Rules, and theſe are the ends that we are to obſerve in this our Feaſt; and let us all for the Honour of Chriſt's Religion, and for the credit of our particular Country, Charge the obſervation of them upon our ſelves: which if we can all reſolve to do, I can ſafely apply to every one of you, that ſaying of <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon</hi> in the ninth Chapter of this Book
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:63712:66"/>of <hi>Eccleſiaſtes,</hi> and the ſeventh Verſe, with which I ſhall conclude: <hi>Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart, for God now accepteth thy work.</hi>

                  <hi>GROTI<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>S</hi> his Note upon this Text is this, that St. <hi>Paul</hi> now having finiſhed this his Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy,</hi> it comes into his Mind that there was need of ſome more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular application to be made, and admo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:63712:68"/>to be given to thoſe Wealthy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, with which the City of <hi>Epheſus</hi> (where <hi>Timothy</hi> reſided) did then abound; and upon this conſideration he inſerts thoſe words I have now read, <hi>charge them that are rich in this World,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>How famous ſoever the City of <hi>Epheſus</hi> was at that time for Wealth or Trade, there is little doubt to be made that this City of ours (praiſed be God for it) doth in thoſe reſpects, at this day, equal if not much exceed it. And therefore that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> thought of ſo great importance as to give eſpecial orders to <hi>Timothy,</hi> to preſs upon the <hi>Epheſian</hi> Citizens, will always be very ſit to be ſeriouſly recomended to you in this place; and more eſpecially at this time, ſince it is the proper work of the day. Waving therefore wholly the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Saviour's <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> upon which you have before been entertained; I apply my ſelf without farther Preface to conclude this <hi>Eaſter</hi> Solemnity with that, with which St. <hi>Paul</hi> concludes his Epiſtle, <hi>viz.</hi> with a ſhort diſcourſe of the <hi>Rich Man's great duty and concernment,</hi> which is in theſe words plainly ſet forth to us.</p>
               <p>In them we may take notice of theſe three Generals, which I ſhall make the heads of my following diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The duty it ſelf incumbent upon thoſe <hi>that are Rich in this World,</hi> expreſſed in ſeveral particulars.</p>
               <pb n="129" facs="tcp:63712:68"/>
               <p>Secondly, The great Obligation that lies upon them to the performance of it, which we may gather from the Vehemence and the Authority with which St. <hi>Paul</hi> orders <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> to preſs it, <hi>charge them</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that are Rich that they be not,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, The mighty encouragement they have to obſerve this <hi>charge,</hi> for hereby <hi>they lay up to themſelves in ſtore a good foundation againſt the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, I begin with the Rich Man's Duty, which is here expreſſed in four points, two of them <hi>Negative,</hi> teaching what things he ought to avoid; the other two <hi>Poſitive,</hi> teaching what he ought to practiſe. They are theſe.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. <hi>That he ſhould not be high minded.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>II. <hi>That he ſhould not truſt in uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain riches.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>III. <hi>That he ſhould truſt in the living God.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>IV. <hi>That he ſhould do good, he rich in good works,</hi> &amp;c.</item>
               </list>
               <p>The firſt thing that is given in charge to all thoſe that are <hi>rich in this World,</hi> is that <hi>they be not high minded,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, that they do not think too well of themſelves for being rich, and take occaſion from
<pb n="130" facs="tcp:63712:69"/>thence to deſpiſe others that are in mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er circumſtances than they. They are not to value themſelves a jot the more, or to think worſe of others upon account of that outward fortune they are poſſeſſed of, but are in all their converſation to expreſs the ſame moderation, and humanity, and eaſineſs, and obligingneſs of temper to thoſe they have to do with, even the meaneſt and the pooreſt, as if they ſtood with them upon the ſame level.</p>
               <p>And with very great reaſon hath St. <hi>Paul</hi> given this caution to rich Men. For by the experience of the World it hath been always found, that Wealth is apt to puff up, to make Men look big, and to breed in them a contempt of others; but what lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ground there is for this, is eaſily ſeen by any that will give themſelves leave to conſider.</p>
               <p>For what doth any of theſe worldly goods (which make us keep at diſtance) really add to a Man in point of true worth and value? do they either recommend him more to God or to wiſe Men, or even to himſelf, if he have a grain of ſenſe in him, than if he was without them? Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly they do not. For that for which ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God approves us, or wiſe Men eſteem us, or we can ſpeak peace and content to our ſelves, is not any thing without us, any thing that fortune hath given to us; but
<pb n="131" facs="tcp:63712:69"/>ſomething that we may more truly call our own, ſomething that we were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther born with, nor could any body hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der us of, nor can be taken from us, that is to ſay, the Riches of our Minds, our vertuous and commendable qualites.</p>
               <p>A Man is no more a fit object of eſteem, merely for being rich, than the Beaſt he rides on (if I may uſe the old compariſon) is of commendation for the coſtly Trap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pings he wears.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Another caution given to thoſe that are rich in this World, is, <hi>that they ſhould not truſt in uncertain riches.</hi> This likewiſe is a temptation to which they are expoſed, and our Saviour hath very lively ſet it forth to us in the Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of the <hi>Rich man</hi> in the Goſpel, who having got mighty Poſſeſſions, and filled his Barns, thought of nothing farther; but preſently ſaith to himſelf,<note place="margin">Luke 12.16, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>Soul take thy eaſe, eat, drink and be merry, for thou haſt goods laid up for many Years:</hi> But the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of that Parable doth ſufficiently ſhew the vanity and ridiculouſneſs of this <hi>truſting in our riches;</hi> for a meſſage comes to him from God, <hi>Thou fool, this night ſhall thy Soul be required of thee, and then whoſe ſhall all theſe things be that thou haſt provided?</hi> It is the greateſt madneſs in the World to pleaſe, or ſpeak Peace to our ſelves upon account of that, which we are
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:63712:70"/>not ſure to enjoy a day, but we may for any thing we know be ſnatch'd away the next moment into another World, and ſo muſt leave the Joy and Pride of our Hearts to we know not whom.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſing we had ſome certainty of our lives, and could promiſe our ſelves that we ſhould not leave our Wealth for ſome competent time, yet we have no cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty that our Wealth will not leave us. How proſperous ſoever our preſent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances be, yet we cannot enſure the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of them; there are a thouſand accidents may happen every day which may ſtrip us as naked as when we came into the World; and we may be reduced to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of thoſe who are now the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt objects of our Compaſſion and Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; and this is that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> in the Text inſinuates when he calls them <hi>uncertain riches.</hi> But what are we then to truſt in, if not in theſe things? this St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſhews in the words following, which make,</p>
               <p>The third inſtance of the Rich Man's Duty, <hi>Let them</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>truſt in the living God, who giveth to all Men richly to enjoy.</hi> The ſenſe of it is this: Let them from the bottom of their Hearts acknowledge God to be the Author and giver of all that they poſſeſs: How much ſoever their Heads projected, or their Hands laboured, or
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:63712:70"/>their Parents and Friends were kind to them, yet it is the Providence of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty to which they owe all. The ſame divine foreſight and contrivance that feeds the Fowls of the Air, and clothes the Flowers of the Field, doth alſo <hi>give them richly all things to enjoy;</hi> and therefore up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that Providence are they entirely to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, as much excerciſing Faith in God, and repoſing confidence in him, as if they had no viſible proviſions made for them: And as heartily returning thanks to their great Benefactor for every Bleſſing they have (ſeem it never ſo much their own alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy,) as a hungry Man that knows not where to get a meal, would to him that ſhould give him a plentiful entertainment. In a word, thoſe that have all things in this World muſt as devoutly look up to God, both in gratefully aſcribing to him every enjoyment either paſt or preſent, and in a full truſt and relyance upon him for what is to come, as thoſe that live from hand to mouth; ſince it is the ſame Divine Providence that feeds and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains both the Poor and the Rich, and of his infinite goodneſs gives to all that fear him, even to the Poor as well as the Rich, all things to enjoy; and though to the one more plentifully, yet to the other perhaps with as much content though not in ſo great abundance.</p>
               <pb n="134" facs="tcp:63712:71"/>
               <p>The Fourth and laſt part of the Rich Man's Duty here mentioned concerns the right uſe of that Wealth that God hath given him. Now the right uſe of Riches according to the Text doth conſiſt in theſe things. That thoſe that have them <hi>do Good</hi> with them, <hi>that they be rich in good works,</hi> that they be <hi>ready to diſtribute, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to communicate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we ſuppoſe every one of theſe diſtinct phraſes in the Text, to denote a diſtinct thing, then we are to give this account of the paſſage, That St. <hi>Paul</hi> here uſeth a gradation in his ſpeech, begins with the loweſt and moſt general expreſſions of Charity, and ſo goes on to higher degrees of it; in each following phraſe intending to ſay ſomething more great or particular than what he had ſaid in the former, which is a moſt uſual and elegant ſcheme of Rhetorick. According to this account (as the words are very capable of it) there are four things here preſcribed to the Rich Man in the uſe of his Riches.</p>
               <p n="1">1. That he do good with them, that is the moſt general point, that is, that he employ them ſome way or other for the benefit of others. He muſt not live to himſelf alone, he muſt deſign greater things than the getting an Eſtate, or the raiſing a Family; if others be not advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:63712:71"/>by him, he is Rich to no purpoſe. And therefore it will concern him to do Kindneſſes and good Offices where he can, to be liberal and hoſpitable, to oblige his Friends and Relations all ways poſſible, to aſſiſt all about him with his counſel, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage them by his example; in a word, to make uſe of that Intereſt and Reputaton that his Fortune hath given him above o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers to do kindneſſes to them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. He muſt not think it ſufficient to do this good now and then, upon particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and more rare occaſions; but he muſt abound in acts of goodneſs. That is the meaning of the Apoſtle's ſecond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of being <hi>rich in good works.</hi> He muſt ſo ſtudy and improve in the Art of doing good, that his good Deeds do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual his Riches; nay the words import that his true Riches are only placed in, and to be meaſured by his good Deeds. He is not to think himſelf farther rich than he is rich in good works. The more plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifully God hath Bleſſed him with worldly Wealth, the more diligent and induſtrious and ſolicitous he muſt be to do good with it, otherwiſe he is poorer than thoſe that perhaps he now and then out of Charity relieves.</p>
               <p>And <hi>3ly,</hi> Leſt this <hi>doing good,</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rich in good works</hi> ſhould only be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted of doing ſuch kindneſſes and good
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:63712:72"/>deeds that coſt us nothing but the expence of our time, or the employment of our pains, or the uſe of our intereſt with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; the Apoſtle adds this farther thing, that the rich Man muſt be ready <hi>to diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute;</hi> that is, very free to part with his Money according to the proportion God hath bleſſed him with, upon every occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of real and uſeful Charity; whether that Charity be of a more publick nature, as for inſtance, when it is expreſſed for the advancing Religion and the ſervice of God, or for the making ſtanding proviſion for the Poor, or laſtly, any way for the ſerving the neceſſities, or increaſing the conveniencies of the place where we live, by any publick uſeful Benefaction: Or <hi>2ly,</hi> whether this Charity be of a more private nature, extending no farther than to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons that come in our way, whom we are convinced to be real objects of it; to theſe likewiſe we muſt be ready to diſtribute; every poor neceſſitous Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon hath a right to part of what we have, if we can really ſatisfie our ſelves, that our Alms will do him a real good, and will not be any great prejudice to us.</p>
               <p>But <hi>4thly</hi> and laſtly, The Apoſtle adds another thing to all this, and that is, that the rich Man muſt <hi>be willing to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate.</hi> If the ſenſe of this phraſe be different from the former, it will ſeem to
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:63712:72"/>import yet a higher degree of Liberality. It will import that rich Men ſhould be of ſuch publick Spirits, and ſo little eſteem their Wealth their own, that it ſhould in a manner be made a <hi>common</hi> thing, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in all ſhould ſhare as there was occaſion. This is the notion of <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>communicating,</hi> as it was uſed in the beginning of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. S. <hi>Luke</hi> in <hi>Acts</hi> 2. having told us that the firſt Chriſtians continued in the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles Doctrine, and in communicating, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently explains what he meant by that communion. <hi>All</hi> (ſaith he <hi>v.</hi> 44.) <hi>that believed were together and had all things common, and ſold their poſſeſſions and goods, and parted them to all Men as every Man had need.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God be thanked the Church of Chriſt is not now in ſuch circumſtances that it is either needful or reaſonable preciſely to obſerve the practice of thoſe times as to this matter. We are not only not obliged to part with the propriety of our Eſtate, and to live in common as the firſt perſecuted Chrſtians did, but we ſhould be highly indiſcreet not to ſay injurious both to our ſelves and the publick if we did. But this notwithſtanding, their practice and the charge here laid upon us to be <hi>communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cative,</hi> will thus far oblige us, <hi>viz.</hi> that we Chriſtians ſhould always retain that publick generous Spirit that they in the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:63712:73"/>firſt times were acted with. We ſhould ſit ſo looſe from the World, and ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned in the diſtinction of <hi>meum</hi> and <hi>tuum,</hi> that we ſhould make it our buſineſs to do good with what we have, thinking our Wealth beſt employed when it is put to that uſe. And when the cauſe of God, and the common intereſt of our Chriſtian Brethren doth require it, we ſhould then as freely part with all we have as our Predeceſſors in Chriſtianity did; follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herein the Precept of our Lord to the young Man who came to enquire of him what he ſhould do that he might in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit Eternal Life, and who was thus an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by our Saviour, that though he had kept the Commandments, yet he wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted one thing to make him perfect (that is to make him a true Chriſtian) and that was, <hi>to ſell all that he had and give to the poor and come and follow him, and then he ſhould have treaſure in Heaven,</hi> Mat. 19.21.</p>
               <p>Thus have I given you a brief account of each particular of the rich Man's Duty as it is ſumm'd up in the Text; and ſome perhaps will think it is ſevere enough; whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be ſo or no I now diſpute not, but I am ſure it is ſeverely required of them. This we may gather from St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s way of urging it, <hi>charge them</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:63712:73"/>are rich in this World that they be not high minded,</hi> &amp;c. He doth not ſay, recommend this to them as a thing that is very reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable in it ſelf, and will highly become them; he doth not ſay, put them in mind of it as a thing by which they may gain a great deal of Honour and Reputation to their Religion; he doth not ſay, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort and perſuade them to it, as a thing that will at laſt conduce to their own ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage: But he ſaith, <hi>charge it upon them,</hi> intimating that there was a neceſſity they ſhould thus practice, it was a duty indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably incumbent upon all of them; and this is the Second General Point I am to inſiſt on.</p>
               <p>And certainly this Order of St. <hi>Paul</hi> to <hi>Timothy</hi> is a ſtanding warrant, a perpetual commiſſion to all Miniſters of the Goſpel, to charge the ſame thing upon all rich Men in all places and times. But in the preſſing and enforcing this charge I ſhall not ſo much have regard to the three former Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties as to the laſt, which concerns the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good with our Wealth, the exerciſing acts of Bounty and Charity as we have opportunity. <hi>Charge them that are rich in this World, that they do good, that they be rich in good works, ready to distribute, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to communicate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now in Four reſpects eſpecially, rich Men are thus to be charged, and a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:63712:74"/>lies upon them to practiſe according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In point of

               </p>
               <p>If all theſe put together do not make the obligation indiſpenſable I know not what will. I will ſpeak briefly of each particular.</p>
               <p>Firſt, if rich Men do not thus employ their Wealth, they are guilty of great <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude.</hi> That is the leaſt evil imputation they fall under, and yet to any ingenuous Man it is heavy enough, for to call a Man <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nthankfull</hi> is as great a reproach as you can caſt upon him.</p>
               <p>Whoever acknowledgeth the Being of God, and owns his Providence in the World, muſt neceſſarily believe that all that portion of good things which he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys in this Life doth proceed from that God as the Author and Fountain, though they be immediately conveyed to him by the Miniſtery of ſecond Cauſes; and his Reaſon and Humanity will ſuggeſt to him, that there are ſome returns of Gratitude to be made to <hi>Him</hi> that of his free bounty hath thus obliged him; but what returns can he make to God for his Bleſſings, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than in communicating thoſe Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:63712:74"/>among his fellow Creatures? To think that a verbal acknowledgment of <hi>God</hi>'s favours is a ſuitable return, is againſt the common ſenſe of Mankind, who know that there goes more to a Man's being truly grateful than the entertaining the Perſon that obliged him with fair ſpeeches and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of his Obligations: And on the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſide, to think of requiting God in a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſenſe, by returning real kindneſſes to him for thoſe he hath done to us, is equally abſurd; for all the ſervices we can pay to him, cannot add any thing to his infinite Bleſſedneſs. How then muſt we expreſs our thankfulneſs for the Wealth that he hath beſtowed upon us? Why he himſelf hath preſcribed the way to us. He hath devol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved his right to our kindneſs upon our Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. He hath deputed them to receive the real teſtimonies of our gratitude to him, and whatſoever obligations we put upon them, he takes them as an expreſſion of our Love and Thankfulneſs to him.</p>
               <p>This our Saviour himſelf hath told us in expreſs words, in the 25 of S. <hi>Matt. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>as ye have done it, i. e.</hi> done acts of kindneſs and charity <hi>to one of the leaſt of theſe my Brethren, ye have done it unto me.</hi> And the charitable contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions of the Hebrew Chriſtians to their indigent Brethren, is by <hi>S. Paul</hi> ſtyled <hi>a work and labour of Love ſhewed to God</hi>
                  <pb n="142" facs="tcp:63712:75"/>himſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. If therefore rich Men would not be unkind and ingrateful to him that gave them all they have, there is a neceſſity they ſhould do good, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, The Practice of this muſt like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe be charged upon them in point of <hi>Juſtice</hi> as well as <hi>Gratitude,</hi> it is a piece of diſhoneſty not to do good with the wealth that God hath given us, for it is a falſifying our truſt, it is an embezling our Maſter's Goods, and putting them to quite other uſes than thoſe he gave us them for. We are not to think that God ever made a Man rich for his own ſake alone, for the ſerving his own turns, and the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of his own private deſires with-without reſpect to the community. No at the beſt we are but the Stewards of God's Bleſſings. A ſtock of Talents he hath committed to all of us, to ſome in greater and to others in ſmaller proportions, and out of this ſtock he hath given us leave to make a proviſion for the neceſſities and conveniencies of our ſelves and our families, but we muſt not think all our own that accrues to us, ſo that it is at our liberty whether we will hoard it up or ſpend it profuſely. No, we muſt have regard to the reſt of our Maſter's Servants. After we have ſerved our own needs we muſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe the ſurpluſage among the Family of God, otherwiſe we are falſe and wicked
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:63712:75"/>Stewards, we abuſe and miſemploy our Maſter's Talents, and a ſevere account we ſhall one day render for ſo doing.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, Mens Religion and Chriſtianity are alſo deeply concerned in this point. Works of Charity are ſo eſſential to all Religion, and more eſpecially to that which we call Chriſtian that without them it is but an empty name in whoſoever pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes it. Let Men pretend what they will, let them be never ſo Orthodox in their belief, or regular in their converſation, or ſtrict in the performance of thoſe Duties that relate to the worſhip of God, yet if they be hard hearted and uncharitable, if God hath given them Wealth, and they have not Hearts to do good with it, they have no true piety towards God. They may have a name to <hi>live,</hi> but they are really <hi>dead.</hi> An unmerciful Chriſtian, or a Religious covetous Man, are terms that imply a contradiction. For the ſatisfying you of this, I ſhall but need to put theſe following queſtions.</p>
               <p>Can that Man be accounted Religious that neither loves God nor his Neighbour? Sure he cannot, for theſe two things are the whole of Religion, as the Holy Scripture often aſſures us; but now the Covetous Man neither doth the one nor the other. His Neighbours he doth not love, that is certain; for if he did they would find ſome
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:63712:76"/>fruits of it; unleſs this be to be accounted Love,<note place="margin">James 2.14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> to give them good words, <hi>to ſay to a Brother or a Siſter that is naked and deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of daily food, depart in peace, be</hi> ye <hi>war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and filled, when notwithſtanding they give them not thoſe things that be needful for the Body.</hi> But this kind of Love S. <hi>James</hi> hath long ago declared not to be worth any thing. And as for the Love of God, another Apoſtle hath put it out of doubt, that the uncharitable Man hath no ſuch thing in him.<note place="margin">1 John 3.17.</note> 
                  <hi>Whoſo</hi> (ſaith S. <hi>John</hi>) <hi>hath this World's good and ſeeth his Brother have need, and ſhutteth up his bowels of compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him?</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>cap.</hi> 4.20.</note> 
                  <hi>For he that loveth not his Brother whom he hath ſeen, how can he love God whom he hath not ſeen?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Can he be thought a Religious Man or a true Chriſtian, that wants the two main qualifications that go to the making up a Diſciple of Chriſt, that is to ſay, <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance?</hi> yet this doth he that is <hi>rich in this World, but is not rich in good works.</hi> Good works are the very ſoul of Faith, and it is no more alive without them than the <hi>Body</hi> is without the <hi>Spirit,</hi> as S. <hi>James</hi> has expreſly told us.<note place="margin">Jam. 2.26.</note> If we mean that our <hi>Faith</hi> ſhould avail us any thing it muſt <hi>work</hi> (or be made perfect) by <hi>Charity,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Gal. 5.6.</note> ſaith S. <hi>Paul,</hi> for though a Man <hi>have all faith</hi> ſo <hi>that he could remove moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains,
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:63712:76"/>i. e.</hi> though he be ſo heartily perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded of the truth of Chriſt's Religion as in the ſtrength of his belief to be able to work Miracles, as was uſual in the firſt times of Chriſtianity, <hi>yet if he have not charity his Faith is nothing.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Cor. 13.2.</note> If it be ſaid that the Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that S. <hi>Paul</hi> makes ſo neceſſary to effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Faith, is not giving Alms but quite ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing, for according to him a <hi>Man may give all his goods to feed the poor,</hi> and yet want the Charity that he ſpeaks of: I anſwer, it is true a Man may give Alms, and very largely, and yet want that Charity that S. <hi>Paul</hi> here ſo much recommends; but then on the other ſide, none can have that Charity that he ſpeaks of, but they will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly expreſs it in Alms and Bounty as they have ability and opportunity: So that for all this ſuggeſtion Alms and Bounty are abſolutely neceſſary to the Efficacy of Faith if there be opportunity of doing them: The plain account of this matter is this, S. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of Charity with reſpect to its inward principle in the heart, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts in an univerſal kindneſs and good-will to the whole Creation of God; and we ſpeak of it with reſpect to the outward fruits of it in the Life and Converſation, which are all ſorts of good works, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly works of Mercy and Bounty: But both theſe come to the ſame thing as to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, for the one always follows the other,
<pb n="146" facs="tcp:63712:77"/>whereever there is Charity in the heart it muſt of neceſſity ſhew it ſelf in theſe kind of actions as there is occaſion, otherwiſe the Charity is not true but only pretended, for as S. <hi>John</hi> hath told us, <hi>He that loveth</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>) <hi>in truth, muſt love</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> 
                  <hi>in work and in deed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then as for <hi>Repentance;</hi> Charity and Alms-giving is a neceſſary ingredient into that alſo.<note place="margin">Luke 3.10, 11.</note> When S. <hi>John</hi> Baptiſt came preaching Repentance unto <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the people asked him ſaying <hi>what ſhall we do?</hi> meaning in what manner they ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs their Repentance: his anſwer was this, <hi>He that hath two Coats let him impart to him that hath none, and he that hath meat, let him do ſo likewiſe;</hi> and ſuitable to this was the Prophet's advice to the King of <hi>Babylon,</hi> when he exhorteth him to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,<note place="margin">Dan. 4.27.</note>
                  <hi>break off thy ſins</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>by righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and thy iniquity by ſhewing mercy to the poor;</hi> that is, evidence thy Repentance by thy Alms-giving and Charity.</p>
               <p>Furthermore, can he be either a good Man or a good Chriſtian, that lives in the habitual neglect of that, which of all other Vertues God in Scripture ſeems to ſet the greateſt value upon; and contrariwiſe pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſeth that which God hath moſt particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly declared his hatred and averſion to? Yet thus doth he that is not charitable with what he hath. So highly acceptable
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:63712:77"/>to God are works of Mercy and Charity, that they are declared to be <hi>the ſacrifices with which he is well pleaſed, Heb,</hi> 13.8. <hi>the things in which he doth delight, Jerem.</hi> 9.24. and <hi>bleſſed</hi> and <hi>happy</hi> are they pronounced that do them, <hi>Pro.</hi> 22.9. <hi>cap.</hi> 14.21. for hereby Men become <hi>the children of God, Luke</hi> 6.35. and entitled to his more eſpecial care and protection, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 41.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> nay ſo dear do they render a Man to his Maker, that the wiſe Son of <hi>Sirach</hi> ſcrupled not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend the practice of them in theſe terms, <hi>Be thou</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>a Father to the Fatherleſs,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Ecclus. 4.10.</note> 
                  <hi>and inſtead of a Husband unto their Mother; ſo ſhalt thou be as the Son of the Moſt High, and he ſhall love thee more than thy own Mother doth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>On the other ſide, if we will believe the Scripture, there is nothing more odious to God than the contrary qualities and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſes. <hi>The love of money,</hi> which is the foundation of all uncharitableneſs,<note place="margin">1 Tim. 6.10.</note> is in Scripture called <hi>the root of all evil;</hi> as cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the greateſt evils and miſcheifs in the World do often take their beginning from thence. Thoſe that are <hi>covetous</hi> are ſtyled by the name of <hi>Idolaters,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Eph. 5.5.</note> than which no more hateful appellation can be given to a Man in the Sacred Language. It is ſaid of the <hi>covetous</hi> that God <hi>abhorreth them;</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 10.3.</note> which implies the utmoſt averſion that the Divine nature is capable of, to any ſort of Men
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:63712:78"/>or things. The uncharitable and hard hearted Men God hath declared he will have no mercy on;<note place="margin">Jam. 2.13.</note> 
                  <hi>but they ſhall have judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment without mercy that have ſhewed no mercy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly and laſtly, a neceſſity there is, that <hi>thoſe that are rich in this World, ſhould do good and be rich in good works, &amp;c.</hi> upon their own account. Though there were no other tye upon them, yet ſelf-love and ſelf-preſervation would oblige them to it. I meddle not here, how far in point of worldly intereſt they are concerned to be charitable, though even the motives drawn from hence are very conſiderable. For cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, Charity is a means not only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and ſecure to them what they have, and to make them enjoy it more comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably, but alſo to increaſe their ſtore. No Man is ever poorer for what he gives away in uſeful Charity, but on the contrary he thrives better for it. God ſeldom fails, in this World amply to repay what is thus lent to him, beſides the other Bleſſings that accompany his ſtore, and go along with it to hs Children after him. This I am ſure is ſolemnly promiſed, and in the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary diſpenſations of Providence we ſee it generally made good: whereas to the greedy and penurious Man, all things fall out quite contrary; he may have Wealth, but he hath little comfort in it; for a curſe generally attends it, of which he feels the
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:63712:78"/>ſad effects in a variouſly miſerable and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xatious life, and often in either having none, or an unfortunate Poſterity.</p>
               <p>But this is not the thing that I mean to inſiſt on. This World laſts but for a while, and it is no great matter how we fare in it; but we have Souls that muſt live for ever. If therefore Men have any kindneſs for them, if they mean not to be undone to all eternity, it is abſolutely neceſſary they ſhould do good with what they have. O that uncharitable rich Men would think upon that woe that our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour pronounceth againſt them.<note place="margin">Luke 6.24.</note> 
                  <hi>Wo unto you that are rich, for ye have received your conſolation.</hi> O that they would ſeriouſly conſider and often remember thoſe words of <hi>Abraham</hi> to the rich Man in <hi>Hell,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 16.25.</note> 
                  <hi>Son</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>remember that thou in thy life receivedſt thy good things, and</hi> Lazarus <hi>evil things; but now he is comforted and thou art tormented.</hi> Not that it is a crime to be rich, or to have good things in our life, no, it is the inordinate love of their Wealth (to which thoſe that have it are too frequently prone) and their not imploying it to thoſe purpoſes of doing good for which it was given; it is theſe things that bring theſe curſes upon them, and really <hi>make it eaſier,</hi> without an Hyporbole, <hi>for a Camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the Kingdom of Heaven, Luke</hi>
                  <pb n="150" facs="tcp:63712:79"/>18.25. Certain it is, there is no one ſin that can be named, doth more fatally exclude from Salvation than this we are ſpeaking of. We never find the Prophets, or the Apoſtles giving a liſt of thoſe black crimes that will involve all that are guilty of them in inevitable deſtruction, but we are ſure to meet with Covetouſneſs, and all the attendants of it among them; as many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances might be given. Nay ſo great is this ſin of Uncharitableneſs, and not doing good with our Wealth, that God in the final ſentence that he ſhall paſs upon wicked Men, to their condemnation at the laſt day, ſeems to take no notice of the other ſins and crimes of their life, but only to cenſure them for this.<note place="margin">Matth. 25.31, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> Thus we find that when the King having gathared all Nations before him, comes to pronounce the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence upon thoſe on his left hand, who are thoſe that are doomed to everlaſting fire; there is no mention made of their criminal actions; they are not condemned for fraud and oppreſſion, for unbelief and irreligion, for lewdneſs and debauchery, though any of theſe be enough to damn a Man: but merely for their not doing good, for their not relieving the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tous, and excerciſing other acts of Charity when it was in their power.</p>
               <pb n="151" facs="tcp:63712:79"/>
               <p>Since now from theſe Conſiderations it doth appear how neceſſary how indiſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable a Duty it is <hi>to do good</hi> with what we have, to be <hi>rich in good works, to be ready to diſtribute, and willing to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate;</hi> let me at this time charge all of you that are <hi>rich in this world,</hi> as you would not be unthankful to your great Benefactor, nor unjuſt to your Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; as you have any piety towards God, or any care of your own Souls, that you put it in practice. And two inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of this great Duty the preſent occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and the exigence of things doth ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige me more particularly to recommend to you.</p>
               <p>The firſt is the buſineſs of the Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals; the encouraging and promoting that Charity which the piety of our Anceſtors begun, and whoſe examples their Succeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors have hitherto worthily followed, and of which we ſee excellent effects at this day; for this we need no better proof than the Report given in of the great number of poor Children, and other poor people maintained in the ſeveral Hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, under the pious care of the Lord May<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or, Commonalty, and Citizens of <hi>London</hi> the year laſt paſt.</p>
               <pb n="152" facs="tcp:63712:80"/>
               <p>For theſe ſo great inſtances of Charity what have we to do, but with all Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude to commemorate thoſe noble and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Spirits that firſt began them; and with all devotion to put up our prayers to God for all thoſe now alive that have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters and encouragers of ſuch good works; and laſtly, with all chearfulneſs and diligence to follow theſe Patterns by liberally contributing to their Maintenance and Advancement. Theſe are th Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Banks and Treaſuries in which we may ſafely lodge that Money which we lend out to God, and may from him expect the Intereſt. O what comfort will it be to us when we come to die, to be able to ſay to our ſelves, That portion of goods that God hath in his Providence diſpenſed to me, I have neither kept unprofitably in a Napkin, nor ſquander'd it away upon my luſts, but part of it I have put out towards the reſtoring my miſerable Brethren to to the right uſe of their reaſon and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; part of it to the amending Mens manners, and from idle and diſſolute per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons redeeming them to vertue and ſobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and making them ſome way profitable to the Publick; part of it for the healing the ſick, and curing the wounded, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving the miſerable and neceſſitous; and laſtly, another part of it towards the Edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cating
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:63712:80"/>poor helpleſs Children in uſeful Arts for their Bodies, and in the Principles of True Religion for their Souls, that ſo both in their Bodies and Spirits they may be in a capacity to glorifie God, and to ſerve their Country. Theſe are all great things, and in which way ſoever of them we lay out our ſelves, we ſerve excellent ends of Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
               <p>But there is another point of uſeful publick Charity, which though the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of this meeting hath nothing to do with it, yet the preſent neceſſity of the thing doth oblige me ſeriouſly to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to you. There are few I believe in this City either ignorant, or inſenſible of the extreme numerouſneſs of Beggars in our Streets, and unleſs care be taken, their number is likely to increaſe, for this ſeems to be a growing evil. I dare not lay the fault of this upon the defectiveneſs of our Laws, nor dare I ſay, that the proviſions made for the Poor, are incompetent or diſproportionable to the number of them; for perhaps the uſual publick Taxes, and private Free-will Offerings diſcreetly mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, would go a great way towards the curing this evil; ſuppoſing the richer Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhes to contribute to the maintaining the poorer. But here is the miſery, we do not ſufficiently diſtinguiſh between our poor; nor take care to make proviſions for
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:63712:81"/>them, according to their reſpective neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities. There are ſome that by reaſon ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of old age, or evil accidents, are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly unable to earn a livelihood for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; or to be any way uſeful to the publick, except by their Prayers and their good examples; and to ſee ſuch go a beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging is a ſhame to our Chriſtianity, and a reproach to our Government. There are others that are fit to labour, and might prove uſeful Members of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth many ways, if they were rightly managed: now the True Charity to theſe is not to relieve them, to the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their idleneſs; but to employ them, to put them into ſuch a way that they may both maintain themſelves and help towards the maintaining of others; and if they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe this, let them ſuffer for their folly; for there is no reaſon <hi>that thoſe ſhould eat that will not work</hi> if they be <hi>able.</hi> A ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity therefore there is, if ever this ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalous publick nuſance of common begging be redreſſed, that theſe four things be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken care of. 1. That thoſe that cannot work be maintained without begging. 2. That thoſe that can work and are wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, have ſuch publick proviſions made that they may be employed in one way or other, according as they are capable, and every one receive fruits of his labour pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionable to his induſtry. 3. That thoſe
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:63712:81"/>that can work and will not, be proſecuted according to the Laws, as Rogues and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants and Peſts of the Kingdom. And laſtly, after ſuch publick proviſions are made for the maintaining both ſorts of Poor that are objects of Charity; that is, the helpleſs, and thoſe that endeavour to help themſelves; that all perſons be exhorted and directed to put their private Charity in the right Channel, wholly withdraw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it from the lazy and the luſty Beggars, leſt they be thereby encouraged in their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous courſe of life, and giving it to thoſe who by publick order ſhall be recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them.</p>
               <p>Theſe things I hope I may without of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence recommend to the Wiſdom and Care of the Government of this Honourable Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, ſince there are both <hi>Heads</hi> enough to contrive the particular ways of curing theſe evils, and <hi>Hands</hi> enough that will be open to contribute what is needful to ſo uſeful a work. Certain it is the thing is practicable, ſince it hath been, and is pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed in ſome Towns of this Nation, and in ſeveral beyond the Seas. And that it is needful, there is none that hath any true ſenſe of Charity (which conſiſts as much in taking care to prevent the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeries and neceſſities of Mankind, as in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving them;) there is none that hath any regard to the Reputation of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion,
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:63712:82"/>or the Honour and good Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of this City, or Kingdom, but muſt needs acknowledge.</p>
               <p>It is one of the great Glories of this Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that as they have been always faithful and prudent in the management of thoſe Publick Charities that they have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with, ſo have they been very rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to encreaſe and to add to them. And God without doubt hath bleſſed them the more for this very thing; as indeed the beſt atonement that any people can make for the many ſins that the place is guilty of, is the Sacrifice of Alms and Charity. And I hope that which condemned <hi>Sodom,</hi> to wit, that <hi>there were not ten righteous men found in it</hi> (that is, Men that were of a Publick Spirit, that were truly Liberal, and Bountiful, and Charitable, for that is an uſual Notion of <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> in the Old Teſtament, and there are ſome paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges in this Hiſtory which make it probable that it may be the notion of it here) I ſay, that very thing it is to be hoped, hath and will preſerve this City of ours; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, as far as we can gather, there are in it many times ten ſuch Righteous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. In truth if there were not ſeveral good Men among us, that by the exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plarity of their lives, and their Charity, do ſtand in the gap between the reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſins of the times, and the Judgments of
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:63712:82"/>God that threaten us for them; it would be a melancholy thing to think what would become of us. But ſo long as God is pleaſed to continue to us a ſucceſſion of thoſe that fear God, and hate covetouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; that make it their buſineſs to do good and to ſerve their generation, there is hopes that he will yet continue to bleſs us. And ſo gracious hath God been to our Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Kingdom in this reſpect, that (to the glory of his name be it ſpoken) what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever boaſts they of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> are wont to make of the Charitableneſs of their Religion, in oppoſition to the penu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſneſs of ours; and reproach us with the bounty and munificence of our Popiſh Anceſtors, and the barrenneſs of their Proteſtant Succeſſors: yet we may ſafely affirm that there have been more publick works of Charity done in this City and Kingdom ſince the Reformation, than can be proved to have been done in the ſame compaſs of years during all the time that Popery prevailed among us.</p>
               <p>O therefore let us go on to do this Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to our Religion, let us go on by our good works to adorn the doctrine of God that we profeſs. Let us not only equal but labour to exceed the Piety and the Publick-ſpiritedneſs of our Forefathers. Let every one both Magiſtrates and People in their ſeveral capacities, be zealous and
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:63712:83"/>vigorous both in conſulting, in contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, and in acting for the publick good as much as is poſſible.</p>
               <p>And for your greater incouragement thus to do, let it be remembred, in the laſt place, that beſides the outward advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages both publick and private that we reap by being charitable; this is the beſt courſe we can take to ſecure our everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Happineſs in the World to come. For <hi>to do good</hi> with our Wealth, <hi>to be rich in good works, to be ready to diſtribute, willing to communicate, is</hi> (as the Apoſtle in the Text tells us) <hi>the way to lay up to our ſelves in ſtore a good Foundation againſt the time to come, that we may lay hold on eternal life.</hi> And this is the Third thing I am to inſiſt on from the Text.</p>
               <p>I mean not here to trouble you with the Criticiſms about the word <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> in the Text, by diſputing whether it ſhould be render'd <hi>Foundation</hi> as it is in our Tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlation; though to lay up a Foundation ſeems an unuſual way of ſpeaking; we do not lay up Foundations but build up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them: or whether the word ſhould be taken to ſignifie the <hi>Bond</hi> or the <hi>Evidence</hi> that God hath given us for the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of his part of the Covenant; as it is uſed by this Apoſtle elſewhere, where he tells us that the <hi>Foundation of God
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:63712:83"/>ſtandeth ſure having this ſeal,</hi> that is to ſay,<note place="margin">2 Tim. 2.19.</note> that Covenant or Indenture, that God hath made with Mankind, ſtandeth ſure, and hath this Seal put to it; for Men do not put Seals to Foundations but to Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants: Or laſtly, whether the word ſhould be rendred a <hi>Treaſure,</hi> ſo as to read the Text thus, <hi>laying up to themſelves a good Treaſure againſt the time to come, that they may lay hold on eternal life.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Vid. Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in loc.</note> The original word (ſay the Learned) is capable or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing tranſlated all theſe ways, and the laſt ſeems as natural as any; for to lay up Treaſure to our ſelves againſt the time to come, is a proper way of ſpeaking, and that which our Saviour frequently uſeth in that very thing we are here treating of. But it matters not much which of them we pitch upon, for they all come to one ſenſe; and that is this, That to be very charitable in this World is a good means to ſecure to our ſelves a title to eternal happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the next.</p>
               <p>But to prevent all miſunderſtanding, that may happen of this point, I deſire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I ſpeak directly to it, to premiſe theſe two things.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Though we do maintain with the Ancient Church, the efficacy of Charity and good works for the furthering a Man's Salvation, yet we utterly reject thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines which the Modern Romaniſts have
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:63712:84"/>advanced in this matter. The Popiſh do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrines about good works are theſe three following, that good works are meritori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; do deſerve the Favour and the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of God Almighty. Again, that the ſurpluſage of a Man's good works, that is to ſay, the merits of ſo many of his good deeds, as are over and above what is ſufficient to ſave his own ſoul, may by the Church be diſpenſed out to the benefit of others, they being part of the Church's treaſure; and upon this foundation they ground their Indulgences. And laſtly, that good works, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Alms of dying per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, that are given to the Church or Clergy, will by the means of the <hi>Maſſes</hi> and <hi>Diriges</hi> that they purchaſe to be ſaid for them, be effectual for the freeing their Souls out of the Torments of <hi>Purgatory.</hi> Theſe are the Popiſh Doctrines concerning good works, which we all juſtly reject, as having no foundation in Scripture, or good Antiquity; and being apparently contrived for the promoting their ſecular gain and advantage. But then as for the neceſſity, or the conduciveneſs of good works to a Man's Salvation, which is all we here plead for, I know no good Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant but doth as earneſtly contend for it as any of that Communion.</p>
               <p>Secondly, Whatever efficacy we attribute to works of Charity as a means for the
<pb n="161" facs="tcp:63712:84"/>obtaining eternal life; we would not be underſtood hereby to exclude the neceſſary concurrence of other Vertues and Graces to that end. It doth not from hence follow, that it is an indifferent matter what Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion a Man is of, or what kind of life he leads, if he be but mighty bountiful to the Poor, and do a great deal of good in his life. No, how acceptable to God ſoever the Sacrifice of Alms and Charity be, yet we are not to expect it ſhall be available to our Salvation, unleſs it proceed from a pure Heart, and be offered with a lively Faith in Jeſus Chriſt, and accompanied with a ſincere endeavour to obey all God's Commandments. Eternal Happineſs is not propoſed in the Goſpel as a reward of any one ſingle Vertue, no not of the greateſt, but of all of them together; if indeed there can be any true Vertue where there is not a conjunction of all; I ſay, if there can be, for St. <hi>James</hi> ſeems to affirm that there can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not. <hi>Whoſoever</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ſhall keep the whole Law, and yet offend in one point,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jam. 2.10.</note> 
                  <hi>he is guilty of all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now having ſaid this by way of caution, to prevent all occaſion that any may take from our ſo earneſtly preſſing Charity, to undervalue and neglect other Duties: It cannot be denyed on the other ſide, that very great effects are by our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour and his Apoſtles, aſcribed to this
<pb n="162" facs="tcp:63712:85"/>vertue with reſpect to Mens Salvation in the other World.<note place="margin">Luk. 6.30, 35.</note>
               </p>
               <p>In the 6. of St. <hi>Luke,</hi> our Lord thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſeth, <hi>Love</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>your enemies, give to him that asketh, do good, and lend, hoping for nothing again, ſo ſhall your reward be great, and ye ſhall be the children of the moſt higheſt.</hi> Now ſure to be entitled to <hi>great rewards,</hi> and to be the <hi>children of the moſt high,</hi> doth look farther than this preſent World. Our Saviour without doubt means the ſame thing here, that he expreſſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſame occaſion in another place, <hi>viz. they</hi> (thoſe that you do good to) <hi>cannot recompence you,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Luk. 14.14.</note> 
                  <hi>but you ſhall be recompenced at the Reſurrection of the juſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again,<note place="margin">Luk. 16.</note> the Parable of the <hi>unjuſt Steward,</hi> that provided ſo well for himſelf againſt a bad time out of his Maſter's Goods, is wholly deſigned to this purpoſe; and that the Application of it ſufficiently ſhews, for our Saviour having ſaid that the Lord of this Steward commended him for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence and care of himſelf, he thus ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies it to all his Diſciples.<note place="margin">verſe 9.</note> 
                  <hi>Wherefore I ſay unto you, make you friends to your ſelves of the Mammon of unrighteouſneſs</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> of theſe falſe deceitful riches) <hi>that when you fail you may be received into everlaſting habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations;</hi> plainly declaring, that the beſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion that rich Men can make for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt the time of their death, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:63712:85"/>to their reception into the other World, muſt be the charitable actions they do with their Wealth while they live here.</p>
               <p>Laſtly,<note place="margin">Luk. 12.33.</note> In another place our Saviour ſaith the very ſame thing in effect that is ſaid in the Text; for this is his counſel to all that mean to be happy in the next life, <hi>viz.</hi> that they <hi>ſell that they have</hi> (that is, when the times are ſuch that it is reaſonable ſo to do) that <hi>they give alms; for thereby they provide to themſelves bags which wax not old, a Treaſure in the Heavens where no thief approacheth, nor moth corrupteth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To theſe three Texts of our Saviour's, I ſhall add three others of three of his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, which ſpeak juſt to the ſame effect, and with them I ſhall conclude. The firſt is that of St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews;</hi> where having ſpoken moſt ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere things, and denounced no leſs than Hell fire againſt the falſe Brethren among them, yet thus he comforts the Church to whom he writes.<note place="margin">Heb. 6.9.</note> 
                  <hi>But beloved</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>we are perſuaded better things of you, and things that do accompany Salvation, though we thus ſpeak.</hi> And what I pray is the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon he is thus perſuaded? Verily this,<note place="margin">ver. 11.</note> 
                  <hi>for God</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is not unrighteous to forget your work and labour of love, which you have ſhewed to his name, in that ye have miniſtred to the Saints, and yet do miniſter.</hi> It was purely their Charity to the Brethren, that
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:63712:86"/>made him have theſe good hopes of them, that they were in a ſtate of Salvation. Though that Church as to other things was in a very degenerate condition, yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering they had been laborious and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent in the exerciſe of Charity, and ſtill continued ſo to be, <hi>God would not forget them,</hi> nay he was not ſo <hi>unrighteous as to forget them.</hi> And then, that which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows in the next verſe is very obſervable;<note place="margin">verſe 11.</note>
                  <hi>And we deſire that every one of you do ſhew the ſame diligence</hi> (to wit, in the practice of Charity) <hi>to the full aſſurance of hope unto the end.</hi> If they would have their hopes of a future life aſſured to them, the way to do it was to perſevere in their diligent at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendence to works of Mercy, and Kindneſs, and Charity.</p>
               <p>The ſecond paſſage is that of St. <hi>John. Hereby</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>perceive we the love of God towards us,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 John 3. 16. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>becauſe he laid down his life for us; and we ought to lay down our lives for the Brethren. But whoſo hath this World's good, and ſeeth his Brother hath need, and ſhutteth up his bowels of compaſſion from him, how dwelleth the love of God in him? My little Children, let us not love in word; neither in tongue, but indeed and in truth, and hereby we know that we are of the truth and ſhall aſſure our hearts before him,</hi> I pray mind that; by our charitable diſpoſition and doing good to our Brethren; by this
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:63712:86"/>we know we are true Diſciples of Jeſus Chriſt, and this is that, that <hi>will aſſure our hearts,</hi> will give us confidence to appear before God at the laſt day when he comes to judge the World. And this is a point that the Apoſtle thinks ſo conſiderable, that he goes over with it again in the next verſe, <hi>Beloved if our hearts condemn us not</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> condemn us not as to this point of Love and Charity) <hi>then have we confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence towards God, and whatſoever we ask, we ſhall receive of him, becauſe we do thoſe things that are pleaſing in his ſight.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The laſt Text to this purpoſe that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fire may be taken notice of, is that of St. <hi>Peter, Above all things, my Brethren,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 Pet. 4.8.</note>
                  <hi>have fervent Charity among your ſelves, for Charity ſhall cover the multitude of ſins.</hi> O how comfortable are theſe words! there is none of us, even the beſt, but hath a multitude of ſins to anſwer for, by what means now muſt we obtain, that theſe ſins ſhall be <hi>covered?</hi> that is, ſhall be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given;<note place="margin">Pſal. 33.1.</note> for covering of ſins is the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of them in the Scripture-language. Why, the Apoſtle hath directed us to the method, <hi>above all things put on Charity, for it is Charity that ſhall cover the multitude of ſins.</hi> Charity is of that power with God, that it alone is able to overcome the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity of many of our ſins and frailties, that would otherwiſe do us miſchief: If
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:63712:87"/>any thing can make atonement for the careleſneſs and the many failings of our lives, and prevent the puniſhment that is due to them, it is to be very charitable, and to do much good: <hi>Charity covers a multitude of ſins in this life.</hi> A great ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny temporal judgments, that would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have fallen upon us for our ſins, are hereby prevented, and that not only pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate ones but publick too: And I think it no Popery to affirm that <hi>Charity will cover a multitude of ſins in the other life alſo.</hi> That is, whoever is of a truly <hi>charitable</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, and doth a great deal of good in his generation, though he may have a great many infirmities and miſcarriages to anſwer for; yet if he be ſincerely vertuous in the main, and ſo capable of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of the other world; his other fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings will be overlooked, they will be bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried in his good deeds, and the Man ſhall be rewarded notwithſtanding. Or if he be a <hi>vitious</hi> perſon, and ſo muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity fall ſhort of the glory that ſhall be revealed; yet ſtill in proportion, the good he hath done in his life <hi>will cover the multitude of ſins.</hi> Though it will not be available for the making him happy, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he is not capable of being ſo; yet it will be for the leſſening his puniſhment. He ſhall be in a much more ſupportable condition among the miſerable, than thoſe
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:63712:87"/>that have been unmerciful, or cruel, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable in their lives. O therefore what remains, but that conſidering all theſe things we ſhould <hi>be ſtedfaſt,</hi>

                  <note place="margin">1 Tim. 4.8.</note> 
                  <hi>hath the promiſe of this life, as well as of that which is to come.</hi> Of this Propoſition of his, the Pſalm we have now before us, may ſeem to be an Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication or Paraphraſe.</p>
               <p>For in this Pſalm Two things are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned, a deſcription of the <hi>Pious</hi> Man; and a deſcription of his <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> in this Life: each of which is done in five inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or particulars.</p>
               <pb n="170" facs="tcp:63712:89"/>
               <p>The terms wherein the <hi>Pious</hi> Man is here diſcrib'd, are theſe following.</p>
               <p>Firſt, He is one that <hi>Feareth God and greatly delighteth in his Commandments,</hi> v. 1.</p>
               <p>Secondly, He is one that is <hi>Righteous</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright</hi> in his Converſation, ver. 4. and 6.</p>
               <p>Thirdly, He is one that is Prudent and Diſcreet in the managing of his Affairs, verſe 5. <hi>He guideth his affairs with diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fourthly, He it one whoſe <hi>Heart is fixed, truſting in the Lord,</hi> v. 7.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, He is one that is extreamly Charitable. He is <hi>gracious and full of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion,</hi> ver. 4. <hi>He ſheweth favour and len<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,</hi> ver. 5. <hi>He hath diſperſed, he hath given to the poor,</hi> ver. 9.</p>
               <p>Now the <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> of ſuch a Man as this, as to this Life, is deſcrib'd in the five inſtances following.</p>
               <p>The firſt of which is, A great and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Poſterity; thus, ver. 2. <hi>His ſeed ſhall be mighty upon earth, the generation of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright ſhall be bleſſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond is, A Plentiful and an Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple Fortune; thus in the third verſe, <hi>Riches and Plenteouſneſs ſhall be in his houſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The third is, A laſting Fame and Repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation; thus again in the third verſe, <hi>His Righteouſneſs remaineth for ever;</hi> and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe
<pb n="171" facs="tcp:63712:89"/>in the ſixth verſe, <hi>He ſhall be had in everlaſting remembrance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The fourth is, Honour and Power and Dignity, even ſuch as ſhall excite the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy of the Wicked; thus in the ninth verſe, <hi>His horn ſhall be exalted with honour, the wicked ſhall ſee it and ſhall be grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The fifth is, Great Safety and Peace in the midſt of Dangerous and Troubleſome times: thus in the Text, <hi>To the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright there ariſeth Light in the Darkneſs.</hi> i. e. <hi>Light</hi> in the greateſt Straits and Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; for that is the meaning of <hi>Darkneſs</hi> in this place. Times of <hi>Darkneſs</hi> in the Scripture Language are Evil and Difficult and Dangerous times. Now upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this <hi>Light</hi> that ariſeth to the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Man</hi> in Evil times, it comes to paſs as it followeth, v. 6, 7, 8. that ſuch a one <hi>ſhall not be moved for ever, neither ſhall he be afraid of evil tidings, for his heart is eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, and he ſhall not ſhrink until he ſee his deſire upon his Enemies.</hi> Or as the Chaldee perhaps better renders it, <hi>until he ſee redemption in diſtreſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the juſt Analyſis of the whole Pſalm. Now of theſe ſeveral Characters whereby the Pious Man is deſcrib'd, I have pitch'd upon that of his <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs</hi> to give an account of, and to recommend to you at this time. And of the ſeveral In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances
<pb n="172" facs="tcp:63712:90"/>of the <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> of ſuch a Man, I have pitch't upon that of <hi>Safety and Peace</hi> in the midſt of Perillous and Troubleſome times. Theſe two points I have choſen to entertain you upon, as judging them moſt ſuitable to the preſent occaſion, and to our preſent circumſtances. And we find them both join'd together in the words of the Text, <hi>To the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright there ariſeth Light in the Darkneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here then we have Two things to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, Firſt, The <hi>Perſon</hi> to whom the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe</hi> here made, or the <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> here mentioned doth belong, It is the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright Man.</hi> Secondly, The <hi>Promiſe,</hi> or the <hi>Bleſſedneſs</hi> it ſelf, It is <hi>Light in times of Darkneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I begin with the Character of the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to whom this Promiſe is made, He is the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright Man,</hi> or as in our more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Language we expreſs him, the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt</hi> Man, the Man of <hi>Integrity.</hi> We all know ſo well what is meant by theſe words, that it would render the thing more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult to offer Critically to give Light to them. As all thoſe General Terms, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by a Man's whole Duty is expreſt in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, have their ſeveral reſpects and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations which difference them one from the other, though they be all equally Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive: So hath this term of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> That which it immediately and
<pb n="173" facs="tcp:63712:90"/>particularly reſpects, is the Goodneſs of a Man's Principles, and the ſuitableneſs of his Actions to them. Or thus, The Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of a Man's Mind to the Eternal Rules of Righteouſneſs, and the Conformity of his Actions to the Principles of his Mind. This is that upon account of which any perſon is denominated Upright, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to this is all Hypocritical and Partial dealings in matters of our Duty. So that if we would give the definition of an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right</hi> Man, it ſhould be in ſuch terms as theſe, He is a Man that in all things fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows the Dictates of his Conſcience. Or, he is One, that makes his Duty the Rule of his Actions. Or, he is One, that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways propoſeth to himſelf Righteous Ends, and purſues thoſe Ends in Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Ways.</p>
               <p>This is the general deſcription of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright</hi> Man: But for the more lively diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of him, and the rendring him, as more Amiable ſo more Imitable, it will be fit that we repreſent him a little more particularly under thoſe ſeveral Reſpects and Capacities in which his Uprightneſs is principally ſeen and expreſt.</p>
               <p>And here we muſt conſider him with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to <hi>God,</hi> and with reſpect to <hi>Men.</hi> Under the former Conſideration we are to view his <hi>Religion,</hi> under the latter his <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil Converſation.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:63712:91"/>
               <p>And none ought to be ſurpriz'd that in the Character of an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright</hi> Man we take notice of his Religious Carriage towards God. For in truth that is a point which is Eſſentially neceſſary to Uprightneſs. He (ſaith <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>that walketh in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs feareth the Lord.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 14.2.</note> Indeed, take away Religion and the Fear of God, and the Foundation of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs</hi> is deſtroy'd. For all the Principles of Conſcience, and all the Obligation to live up to thoſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, is thereby taken away. He that hath no ſenſe of God and Religion, can never think himſelf bound to obſerve any Rules in his Actions and Behaviour, but what are ſubſervient to the carrying on his private ſenſual worldly Intereſt: And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, whatever is Inconſiſtent with that, be it never ſo baſe and vile and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious, he cannot take himſelf in point of Duty oblig'd to ſtick at it, when he hath the leaſt temptation to it. The reſult of which is, That he may commit all the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lanies in the World, and yet think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as Innocent, and his Actions as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, as if he had been never ſo Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and Vertuous.</p>
               <p>He therefore that is an <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright</hi> Man, hath a ſerious and hearty ſenſe of God and Religion upon his Spirit, and is above all things careful to preſerve and increaſe that ſenſe. But then his conduct in this
<pb n="175" facs="tcp:63712:91"/>affair is much different from that of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary pretenders to Religion.</p>
               <p>For he is a Man that doth not content himſelf with a mere ſpeculative belief, or an outward profeſſion of the Truths of Religion; but doth ſo far impreſs them on his Heart, that they influence his whole Life and Converſation. He doth not think it ſufficient to be Orthodox in his Opinions; or to be a Member of a True Church; or to be zealous in maintaining and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the right way: But he takes care to live as he believes; to practiſe ſuitably to the prefeſſion he makes. As he holds faſt the <hi>Form</hi> of <hi>Godlineſs;</hi> ſo he never fails to expreſs the <hi>power</hi> of it, in an Innocent and a Vertuous Life.</p>
               <p>He is a Man, that in the whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of his Religious affairs, minds Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience more than any ſelfiſh conſideration. He takes not up his Principles either out of Humour, or Paſſion; to advance his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, or to pleaſe a Party: But he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves a thing becauſe it is True, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth it becauſe it is his Duty. In matters of Religion he hath the indifference of a Traveller, whoſe great concernment is to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at his Journeys end; but for the way that leads thither, be it high or low, all is one to him, ſo long as he is but certain that it is the Right Way.</p>
               <pb n="176" facs="tcp:63712:92"/>
               <p>And as he doth not chuſe his Religion out of worldly conſiderations: So neither doth he quit it upon ſuch. But is reſolute and conſtant in bearing witneſs to the Truth, againſt all oppoſition whatſoever. As he doth not make ſhew of his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the more when it is in faſhion, and when it may prove advantagious to him: So neither doth he practiſe it the leſs when it may prove Ignominious or Dangerous. He is obſtinately tenacious of his Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples when he knows them to be good; and prepared to endure the utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities rather than violate the Laws and Dictates of his Conſcience.</p>
               <p>He is a Man that thinks Religion too Sacred a thing to be proſtituted to mean purpoſes; and therefore he never uſeth it as an Inſtrument for the ſerving a turn; never makes it a Cloak for the covering a private end, though he were ſure he could compaſs his deſigns by it. He knows that the greateſt Impoſtures have laid hid under this mask, and by ſuch Artifices God hath been often made a Patron of the moſt horrid villanies.</p>
               <p>He is a Man that doth not place his Religion in outward forms and ſervices; or in little cheap Duties that coſt him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing. He hath a nobler ſenſe of God than to think that ſuch things can alone re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend us to him: And therefore his
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:63712:92"/>principal concernment is about the great Indiſpenſable Duties of Chriſtianity.<note place="margin">Matt. 23.23.</note> 
                  <hi>The weightier matters of the Law, Juſtice and Mercy and Faith.</hi> He hath the everlaſting Notions and differences of Good and Evil deeply ingraven in his Heart, and in the practiſing or the avoiding them, he chiefly lays out himſelf.</p>
               <p>He is a Man, that doth not pick and chuſe out of God's Commandments, which to obſerve to the neglect of the reſt: but endeavours Uprightly and Sincerely to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them all. He calls no ſin little, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his temper inclines him to it, or the courſe of his Life leads him more frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly into the Temptations of it. But he hath an hearty uniform Averſion to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing that is Evil. He holds no ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret friendſhip or correſpondence with any Enemy of God; but fights as reſolutely againſt his moſt agreeable and moſt gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſins, as thoſe that he hath leſs Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to upon thoſe accounts.</p>
               <p>He is a hearty Enemy to all Factions in Religion, as knowing the Life and Soul of Chriſtianity is often eaten out by them. All dividing Principles he abhors; and as much as he loves <hi>Truth,</hi> he is not leſs concerned for <hi>Peace.</hi> And he is better plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with one Inſtance of his Charity in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing, or his Zeal in Suppreſſing Religious Differences, than with twenty of his Skill
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:63712:93"/>and Abilities in diſputing them. For he knows that LOVE is more acceptable to God than a right Opinion; and <hi>to be a Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyr rather than divide and rend the Church,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Dionyſ. Alex. <hi>in</hi> Euleb.</note>
                  <hi>is not leſs Glorious than to be a Martyr for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing to offer Sacrifice to Idols.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, He is a Man, Religious without Noiſe; and uſes no little Arts to make his Piety taken notice of in the World. For he ſeeks not the praiſe of Men in any thing he doth, but ſtudies to approve himſelf to God only. And therefore he is as careful of his Thoughts, as of his Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and hath the ſame fear of God, and regard of his Duty, when no Man ſees him; as when he is in the moſt publick places.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the great ſtrokes of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightneſs</hi> as to <hi>Religion.</hi> And whoever makes good theſe Characters, may unqueſtionably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude of himſelf, that he is an <hi>Honeſt Man</hi> to <hi>God-ward,</hi> a <hi>true Iſraelite indeed, in whom there is no guile.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Come we now, in the ſecond place, To take a view of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright-Man</hi> in his civil Converſation: To give ſome account of him with reference to his Carriage and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanour amongſt Men. And here again we muſt conſider him under two capacities, as a <hi>Private</hi> Perſon, and as a <hi>Magiſtrate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And Firſt, As a Private Perſon, The general Rule by which he frames and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:63712:93"/>his whole Converſation, is ſuch a prudent and diligent care of himſelf, and his own good, as is not only conſiſtent with, but doth effectually tend to promote the Good and Happineſs of all others that he deals with. This is the Fundamental Principle which he lays down to obſerve in all his commerce with Mankind. For he conſiders that every Man in the World hath a right to be happy as well as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: And he conſiders, that, as things are ſo contriv'd, that he cannot be happy without the aſſiſtance of others: So it is infinitely reaſonable that he in like manner ſhould contribute his endeavours to the making them happy alſo. Theſe now being the main Principles of his Mind, he takes care in his whole Converſation that his Actions and Carriage be ſuitable to them, and bear ſome proportion with them.</p>
               <p>And therefore, we may be ſure that he is a Man exactly Juſt in all his dealings, and would not knowingly do the leaſt wrong or injury to any, though he could gain never ſo much by it; and were he ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo ſecure that he could do it without diſcovery.</p>
               <p>He is a Man, that where he is truſted, is faithful to the uttermoſt. Never ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king advantages of Mens credulity, nor abuſing the conſidence they repoſe in him.</p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:63712:94"/>
               <p>He is one, that in point of fair dealing between Man and Man, is ſevere even to Scrupuloſity; and he would rather ſit down with loſs, than ſerve his own ends by any practice that hath but a bad report, that hath but even the appearance or ſuſpicion of evil in it; though in the mean time he knows that what is got by ſuch practices is by ſome Men accounted lawful gain.</p>
               <p>He is a Man of great candour, and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and obligingneſs in his Behaviour: But withal, as on one hand he is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful not to run himſelf into Inconveniencies by his good nature: So on the other hand, the kindneſs and good-will he profeſſeth to all about him, is more than a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or a ſemblance of his countenance. For his fair ſpeeches are always attended with honeſt dealings; and what he once promiſeth, he is punctual in making it good, though it be to his own prejudice.</p>
               <p>He is a Man that loves a good Name and Reputation, as well as any one, and is extremely tender of it; but yet he ſcorns to make uſe of any evil Arts, either for the procuring, or preſerving it.</p>
               <p>And conſequently, he is a Man that hates all mean and ſervile compliance, and will neither ſpeak nor do any thing againſt the ſenſe of his Mind for the humouring any. Flattery and Diſſimulation he abhors, and he dares ſpeak his Mind, when he
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:63712:94"/>judges it fit and reaſonable; even though he knows the doing it will give offence.</p>
               <p>And as he is perfectly averſe to all Faw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and Flattery: So he is above Envy and Detraction. He never leſſens another Man to make himſelf greater; nor looks upon the proſperity of his Neighbour with an evil Eye; backbiting, and carrying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout idle ſtories is not the thing he lives by. He puts a fair conſtruction upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Mens Words and Actions, and will rather conceal a real fault, than make it worſe in the reporting it. He hopes and thinks the beſt of all Men; and rejoyceth in the happineſs of thoſe about him. He doth as much good as he can; and that good that is done by others, he is ſo far from envying, that he thanks God for it as if he had done it himſelf.</p>
               <p>He is a Man of great Plainneſs and Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity; apert and open, and free in all his Carriage. You may always know where to have him, for his Words and his Thoughts always go together. And though he is care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful not to be laviſh of his Speech, nor at all times to diſcover all his Mind: Yet he is as careful, that what he doth ſpeak ſhall be agreeable to Truth; and he ſo ſpeaks it that thoſe that hear him may take meaſures of his Mind from it.</p>
               <p>He is a Man, who though he be very watchful of opportunities to do himſelf
<pb n="182" facs="tcp:63712:95"/>good, and very ſagacious in ſpying dangers, and avoiding them: Yet he never uſes any indirect means, either for the benefiting or ſecuring himſelf. He ſcorns to make ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of any Man's neceſſities: Nor will he undermine another for the effecting of his own deſigns. Deceit and Colluſion are ſtrangers to all his dealings. Above all things he hates a Trick; and in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count to be a Man of Intrigues, a cunning or a ſhrewd Fellow, is but a more gentile term for a Knave.</p>
               <p>In a word, the deſigns he propoſeth to himſelf are all Honeſt and Juſt, and ſuch as tend to the good of the Community as well as his Own, but to no Man's loſs or hindrance. And the means he uſeth for accompliſhing theſe deſigns, are all fair and regular; and ſo free is both his Heart and his Actions from all Impoſture, that he cares not if all the World were privy to them.</p>
               <p>This is the Man that is <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright</hi> in his <hi>Converſation</hi> towards <hi>Men.</hi> The Man that with the Wiſdom of the Serpent joyns the Innocence and Simplicity of the Dove.</p>
               <p>But thus much of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright</hi> Man as a <hi>Private</hi> Perſon; Let us now view him a little under a more conſpicuous character. Let us conſider him as a <hi>Magiſtrate</hi> intruſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the management of publick affairs. (Which is the Second particular we are to
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:63712:95"/>inſiſt on under this head) and here the Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Man is ſtill the ſame, acted by the ſame Principles, purſuing ſtill the ſame deſigns we have hitherto mentioned. One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his Vertues have another Sphere and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Object, and therefore require ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther conſideration.</p>
               <p>The great thing he propoſes to himſelf in taking any Office upon him, is the glory of God, and the publick good. The Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Dignity of the place, and the other worldly advantages that may attend it, are but ſecondary conſiderations with him. The firſt is his main deſign, which he ſteadily and conſtantly purſues throughout the whole Adminiſtration of his Office; the other is never thought on but with ſubordination to the former.</p>
               <p>And therefore acting from ſuch Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples as theſe, we may eaſily conclude him to be a Man whoſe Counſels and Actions are not ſteer'd by the wind of popular Applauſe, but by the ſenſe of his Duty. He ſtudies not to ingratiate himſelf with Men, but to diſcharge a good Conſcience. He is more careful to be a <hi>Good</hi> Magiſtrate than to be a <hi>Loved</hi> one; though (ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily are things contriv'd, that) in being the former he rarely fails of the latter.</p>
               <p>The conſequence of which is, that he is a Man of great Courage and Boldneſs, and Reſolution. He dares to do whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:63712:96"/>is fit, and juſt, and conducive to the publick good, what diſcouragements ſoever he meet with. Neither the menaces of the Mighty, nor the murmurings of the Multitude, can fright him from his Duty. For he dreads none but God; nor fears to do any thing but what is misbecoming him.</p>
               <p>But then he is a Man that doth not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve things haſtily, and upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of a few particulars, but takes good advice, and uſeth mature deliberation before he determines himſelf. He doth nothing precipitately: But weighs all things repreſented to him, as impartially as he can. His Ears are open to all Parties, and he debates what is ſaid, without Paſſion or Prejudice or Prepoſſeſſion; and he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways conſiders more what is ſpoken, than who it is that ſpeaks it.</p>
               <p>He is a Man whom you cannot ſo much diſoblige as by attempting to corrupt him. Neither the regard of his profit, nor his kindneſs to his Friends, can in Matters of Right, tempt him to act againſt his inward ſenſe. As to theſe things he is as blind as Juſtice herſelf, and you may as ſoon draw the Sun from his line, as him from the ſteady and ſtrict paths of Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p>He is a Man that looks upon his Office rather as a burthen, than a preferment. And therefore he is wonderfully ſolicitous about the well diſcharging it. His care
<pb n="185" facs="tcp:63712:96"/>and ſtudy is chiefly employed upon the Publick, and he rather ſuffers the miſcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of his own affairs than that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity by his negligence ſhould receive any prejudice. While others are doing their own buſineſs, he is watching for the common good; for he always remembers that he is a publick perſon, and that the time and ſtrength that God affords him are not his, but theirs, by and for whom he is intruſted.</p>
               <p>He is a Man that imploys all his power and intereſt, as much as is poſſible, for the maintenance of the worſhip and ſervice of God, and the defence and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the true Religion. For he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders God, as the firſt and principal per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be reſpected in all Governments and Societies, as being not only the Author but the Head of them. And he remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers that Religion doth ſo much influence the Civil State, that the happineſs and ruin of Cities and Kingdoms are link'd with the well or ill management of it.</p>
               <p>And in purſuance of this his Zeal for God and Religion, he takes care, as much as in him lies, to encourage thoſe Perſons that are Vertuous and Good, and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs and bring out of credit all Vice and Debauchery, all Impiety and Irreligion, all Faction and Diſorder; together with the Maintainers and Abettors of them.</p>
               <pb n="186" facs="tcp:63712:97"/>
               <p>He is a Man, that effectually makes good <hi>Job</hi>'s Character of himſelf, who was alſo a Magiſtrate:<note place="margin">Job 29.14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>He puts on Righteouſneſs and it cloaths him, his Judgment is a Robe and a Diadem: He is Eyes to the Blind, and Feet he is to the Lame: He is a Father to the Poor, and the cauſe which he knoweth not he ſearcheth out: He breaketh the Jaws of the Wicked, and plucketh the Spoil out of his Teeth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He is a Man that looketh upon himſelf to have a Truſt both with reference to to thoſe above him, and thoſe under him: And therefore he is careful to carry himſelf with an even ſteady hand, with reſpect to both; ſtudiouſly endeavouring, both to preſerve his Allegiance to his Prince, and his Fidelity to the Publick: Neither invading the Rights of the one, nor injuring the Liberties of the other.</p>
               <p>He is one, that, next to the Honour of God, ſtudies the Peace and Quiet of the Place where he is concern'd. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as on one hand he is watchful in ſpy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out Dangers, and quick in applying ſuch Remedies to them as are proper in the Place and Station he holds: So on the other ſide he neither takes nor gives the Alarm upon every ſlight Surmiſe, or popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Apprehenſion. He makes the beſt of all things that happen; and by his Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Moderation endeavours to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſh
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:63712:97"/>growing Flames rather than add Fewel to them; to calm and allay Mens Jealouſies and Animoſities, rather than to excite and increaſe them.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, To conclude; He is a Man, that fears God, that honours the King; that is obſervant of the Laws; that is true to the Government; and that meddles not with them that are given to change.</p>
               <p>Having thus given you an account of the Upright Man, under the ſeveral prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal relations in which he ſtands; I come now in the ſecond place, for the comfort of all that are ſuch, and for the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of all others to endeavour to be ſuch; to ſet forth the advantages and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, that ſuch a Man enjoys in evil and dangerous times. <hi>To the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright there ariſeth Light in the Darkneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Darkneſs,</hi> as I told you before, is a word by which the Scripture expreſſeth any kind of Straits, or Difficulties, or Adverſities. Thus <hi>Job</hi> 15.21. <hi>Darkneſs</hi> is there oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to <hi>Proſperity;</hi> thus <hi>Lam.</hi> 3.2. <hi>I am the man,</hi> (ſaith the Prophet) <hi>that have ſeen Affliction, by the rod of his wrath he hath led me and brought me into Darkneſs.</hi> And thus likewiſe, to name no more Texts, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.2. The day of God's Viſitation up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> is called <hi>a Day of Gloomineſs and Darkneſs; a Day of Clouds and thick Darkneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:63712:98"/>
               <p>This now being the Notion of <hi>Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs:</hi> when it is ſaid in the Text, <hi>To the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright Man there ariſeth Light in the Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;</hi> By <hi>Light</hi> we may underſtand any one of theſe three things, that is to ſay,</p>
               <p>By <hi>Light,</hi> we may underſtand <hi>Light</hi> for his <hi>Guidance</hi> and <hi>Direction;</hi> and then the ſenſe is, That in critical and perillous times the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright</hi> Man of all others, will be beſt enabled to order and manage his Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.</p>
               <p>Or ſecondly, By <hi>Light</hi> we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>Safety</hi> and <hi>Defence,</hi> as the word is ſometimes taken in Scripture; and then the ſenſe is, That in evil times the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>p<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right</hi> Man walks moſt free from danger; He of all others may expect ſecurity and protection in a common Calamity.</p>
               <p>Or thirdly, By <hi>Light</hi> we may under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand <hi>Peace</hi> and <hi>Joy</hi> (as that likewiſe is another uſual ſenſe of the word,) and then the meaning is, That in evil times, let things happen as they will, though it ſhould be the fortune of the Upright Man to be oppreſt in the Crowd; yet this hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs he will always have, that his Mind will be at perfect eaſe and peace. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſhall ever diſcompoſe him, but in the midſt of his Sufferings his Heart ſhall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleniſhed with perpetual Comfort.</p>
               <pb n="189" facs="tcp:63712:98"/>
               <p>In any one of theſe ſenſes the Text may be taken, and in all the Three it fails not to be made good to the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright</hi> Man.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>To the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright Man there ariſeth Light in the Darkneſs,</hi> taking <hi>Light</hi> for <hi>Guidance</hi> and <hi>Direction.</hi> Be the times ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo dark, he hath this happineſs, that he is rarely at a loſs how to ſteer his courſe. He finds his way eaſily, when other Men are quite bewildred; and he readily expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dites himſelf out of ſuch difficulties as thoſe that act by other principles find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves grievouſly intangled with. This is a thing that ſhould mightily recommend the practice of Uprightneſs, eſpecially in evil times; and that it is really attended with this advantage, muſt needs be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged upon theſe two accounts.</p>
               <p>Firſt, To an Upright Man his way lies plainer, and is more eaſily ſeen and diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered.</p>
               <p>And Secondly, He hath a greater Light to ſee it by, than thoſe that take other mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures in the management of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Upright Man of all others moſt eaſily ſees his way, for it lies plain and even, and ſtrait before him. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the ways of Vice and Wickedneſs are extremely crooked, full of windings and turnings.</p>
               <pb n="190" facs="tcp:63712:99"/>
               <p>Whoever purſues evil Deſigns, and is a Slave to baſe Affections, muſt neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle himſelf in infinite Labyrinths, through the courſe of his Life. For ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving ſeveral ends to purſue, and thoſe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times inconſiſtent one with another: it cannot be avoided but that in many cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances he lights into, he will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely at a loſs how to behave himſelf. If he go this way, then will ſomething come to Light, which he ſtudiouſly endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to conceal; if he go that way, then he diſobliges ſome Man or ſome Party whoſe intereſt is neceſſary to ſupport him; If he go a third way, he deſtroys that which is his main deſign. At what a loſs now in ſuch a caſe as this muſt a Man needs be in the determining himſelf? Upon what a rack is his underſtanding put, to get fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rid of theſe Difficulties? And yet ſuch Dilemmas as theſe is every one that walks not Uprightly, ever and anon crampt with in his Counſels and Delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſe he get well over the preſent Difficulty, yet he is but where he was; For upon the next emergency of Affairs, he is as much puzled and nonpluſt as before. The ſame method will not ſerve him twice for the carrying on his deſigns. As often as new occaſions ariſe, ſo often muſt he alter his Counſels, and take new meaſures:
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:63712:99"/>ſo that he is always unſteady, often inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtent with himſelf; utterly unreſolv'd what Man he ſhall be, or what part he ſhall act, in the next Scene that offers it ſelf.</p>
               <p>Theſe Difficulties and Perplexities the Man of Intrigues is always hamper'd with; and they neceſſarily ariſe from the various flexures and turnings of the way that leads to his ends: But the contrary of all this is the Lot of the Upright Man. For his way neither lies on this ſide, nor on that ſide, but always ſtrait forward. He hath but one great end to purſue, and that is to diſcharge a good Conſcience: all his other concernments are wholly regulated by that. The conſequence of which is, That he hath no claſhing of intereſts to perplex his deliberations; no little turns that muſt be ſerved, to divert him to the right hand or to the left, but he always looks ſtraight before him: ſo that all his reſolutions are eaſily made; moſt of thoſe Difficulties that intangle other Men are quite cut off and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided; his Counſels and his Methods are always the ſame; and he is ſeldom at a loſs how to behave himſelf upon a new emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency. In a word, his way is commonly ſo plain that he ſtands in need of little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice or inſtruction for the finding it. And this is that which <hi>Solomon</hi> hath told us, <hi>The Integrity of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright ſhall guide him.</hi> For,<note place="margin">Prov. 11.3. cap. 4.18.</note>
                  <hi>the path of the juſt is a ſhining light.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="192" facs="tcp:63712:100"/>
               <p>But 2dly, If it be his Lot to fall into ſuch circumſtances, where his way is not ſo plain, but that there is need of great advice and deliberation what courſe to ſteer; as it of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten happens, eſpecially in ſuch times as the Text ſpeaks of: Yet here the Upright Man hath the advantage of all thoſe that walk by different principles; for (all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther things equal) he has more <hi>Light</hi> to direct him in the finding of his way than they have.</p>
               <p>There is this difference, between a Man that walks Uprightly in all his converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and a Man that hath ſiniſter ends of his own to purſue: The former hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the free uſe of his Intellectual Powers, and can exert his Reaſon in its higheſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, and to the beſt advantage: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as the latter is horribly clouded in his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Faculties. He hath conſtantly a miſt before his Eyes, which hinders him from rightly diſtinguiſhing the objects he looks upon; and conſequently occaſions many blunders and miſtakes in the choice of his way.</p>
               <p>My meaning is this, Whoever frames his Life by other Meaſures than thoſe of Honeſty and Conſcience; whoever intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately purſueth his private ends or is a ſlave to inordinate Paſſions let them be of what kind they will: Theſe things do clap ſuch a Byas upon his Soul, as renders
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:63712:100"/>him utterly uncapable of making a right judgment of things before him, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently muſt unavoidably expoſe him to a great many dangerous errours in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of his affairs; and this often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in Matters that have no great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty in them.</p>
               <p>Take any one of the Paſſions that uſually govern the Man that hath no principles of Conſcience; let it be either Fear, or Envy, or Revenge, or Vain-glory, or Avarice, or Ambition; it is a wonderful thing to ſee how monſtrouſly they diſtort his Reaſon, and what odd extravagant courſes they put him upon; and this even in plain eaſy caſes; Nay, though the Man, in other things, where his affections have no influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, be a very wiſe Man. One could ſcarce imagine the power that theſe things have over a Man's Judgment; but that we every day ſee ſuch ſtrange inſtances of it.</p>
               <p>But now the Upright Man is not in the leaſt obnoxious to any of theſe inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences: For having no turns to ſerve but thoſe that are honeſt and good; having no private Affections or Paſſions to be gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified; he looks upon things in a pure and ſimple Light, and not through a coloured Glaſs. And conſequently, his conceptions of them as far as humane endeavours can ſecure, are according to their Nature; and his determinations and reſolutions are ſui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:63712:101"/>to his conceptions; that is to ſay, are reaſonable and fit, and ſuch as become the occaſion. As his main deſign is to do in all inſtances that which is beſt; ſo that deſign preſerves him from miſtaking in his Notions of what is beſt. His Reaſon and Underſtanding are free and at liberty; and if there do ariſe any knot or difficulty, he of all others is likely to untie it with the greateſt eaſe. And this is that which the Pſalmiſt hath told us, <hi>The fear of the Lord is the beginning of Wiſdome, a good <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding have all they that do thereafter.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>But Secondly, If we take <hi>Light</hi> for Safety and Security, for Defence and Protection, as it is ſometimes uſed in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: In this ſenſe alſo <hi>Light ariſeth to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright in times of Darkneſs.</hi> For ſuch a Man may in the worſt of times, above all other Men, promiſe theſe things to himſelf. And this is that which <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>He that walketh <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightly walketh ſurely.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Prov. 10.9.</note> And indeed this ſeems to be the thing principally intended in the Text; The <hi>Light</hi> which is here ſaid to <hi>ariſe to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright in Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> ſeemeth chiefly to reſpect his Security from Danger in the times of a Common Calamity; as appears by what immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately followeth; viz. <hi>He ſhall not be moved for ever; he ſhall not be afraid of evil tidings, his heart ſhall not ſhrink untill he ſee his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire upon his Enemies.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:63712:101"/>
               <p>Now this Security in times of Danger the Upright Man may expect upon theſe two accounts. Firſt, his Uprightneſs in its own Nature (as things are contrived and carried on in the World) doth above all other things conduce to it. And Secondly, He is upon account thereof intituled to God's more particular Protection.</p>
               <p>Firſt, The Paths of Uprightneſs are in themſelves ſuch as naturally tend to ſecure a Man in Evil and Dangerous times.</p>
               <p>For firſt, They do really contribute to the Good and Happineſs of the Publick, in the which every Man's private ſafety is in a manner bound up.<note place="margin">Prov. 11.11.</note> 
                  <hi>As by wickedneſs</hi> (they are the words of <hi>Solomon</hi>) <hi>a City is over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrown: ſo by the bleſſing of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright it is exalted.</hi> Every Upright Man is really a benefactor to the Publick: For by him and ſuch as he, Cities and Kingdoms are ſupported which would otherwiſe fall into confuſion. The whole Body Politick owes its preſervation to the vertuous Care, and honeſt endeavours of Upright Men. And e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very ſuch Man in particular reaps the bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit of ſuch his Endeavours; for he ſhares in his own Perſon that protection and ſecurity he procures to the Community. And if he had not been Upright, as the Publick would have fared ſomething the worſe for it: So it is certain he in his private Capacity, would in the ſame proportion, have fared the worſe alſo.</p>
               <pb n="196" facs="tcp:63712:102"/>
               <p>But this conſideration of the conducive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Honeſty and Uprightneſs to the Good of the Publick, I direct chiefly to thoſe that are in Office and Authority; for really their carriage and conduct hath a more than ordinary ſtroak in the good or bad ſucceſs of the common affairs. And therefore it concerns them eſpecially to look to themſelves, that they be Men of Integrity, and keep a Good Conſcience in the diſcharge of their Truſt. Upon their Upright walking, the ſafety and preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Publick doth more depend, than upon the Endeavours of a thouſand private Men. Though they are but particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, yet being veſted with Authority, their Conduct and Management hath as great an influence upon the common Good or the common Ruin, as if they were a Multitude; and ſingle as they are, they do in a great Meaſure carry the Balance of the publick Fortune in their Hands.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> The conduciveneſs of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man's Uprightneſs, to the publick good is not the only conſideration, upon which it is recommendable, as a means for ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining ſafety and ſecurity in evil times. For let the Publick go as it will: In the worſt of times, if any Man can in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability be thought able to ſhift for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; if any Man can in reaſon hope to e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcape the Violence and Iniquity of the times,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:63712:102"/>the Upright Man, the Man of Honeſty and Integrity is likelyeſt to be the Man: I ſay in reaſon he is likelyeſt, and as things commonly go.</p>
               <p>For he of all others takes the ſureſt courſe to preſerve himſelf; and is leaſt obnoxious either to the malice or the envy, the undermining or the rapine, of open Enemies or pretended Friends.</p>
               <p>All Knavery and diſhoneſt Dealings ſet a Man up for a Mark to be ſhot at; but Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs and Integrity is a Shield and a Protection.</p>
               <p>The Upright Man doth ſo order the courſe of his Life, that he uſually avoids all thoſe Rocks that other Men ſplit upon, and which uſually prove their ruin. The undoing of moſt Men even in evil times, lies commonly at their own door, and they may thank themſelves for it. If they had been ſufficiently careful of themſelves, the malignity of the times would ſcarce have touch'd them. It is generally either very great careleſneſs and groſs neglect of their own affairs; or the laviſhneſs or intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of their Tongues; or an ill gotten E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtate; or private Injuries they have done, and private Grudges they have contracted; or pragmaticalneſs in other Mens Matters; or factious adherence to a Party; or breach of Truſt; or treachery to the Publick, or the like: I ſay, it is theſe things that do
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:63712:103"/>moſt commonly draw Miſchief upon Mens Heads, and lay the Foundations of all thoſe ſtraits and difficulties in which they are intangled even in the worſt of times. But now the Upright Man doth in a great Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure avoid all theſe occaſions; for his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples do oblige him to walk in a way that is diametrically oppoſite to the things I have mentioned.</p>
               <p>The Upright Man treads upon ſuch ſure Foundations, and his Ways are ſo univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally approved by Mankind; that, as things uſually go, no Man will eaſily offer him injury, but it will be to his own detriment.</p>
               <p>The Rule he walks by is ſuch, as doth effectually procure him the moſt Friends and the feweſt Enemies, for he takes the courſe to oblige all ſorts of Men; and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently he cannot eaſily fail of finding thoſe who will uſe their utmoſt endeavour to aſſiſt and reſcue him, when he lights in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any difficult circumſtances.</p>
               <p>His righteous converſation is ſo unexcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable; and ſo prudent he is in the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement of his affairs; that thoſe that love him not, will not eaſily find an occaſion to do him much miſchief.</p>
               <p>Even thoſe that have no acquaintance with him, yet have ſo much concernment for Honeſty and Uprightneſs in general, that they will ſtudy to give him what aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and defence they can, out of a natural
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:63712:103"/>ſenſe that it is fit a good Man ſhould be protected; and that, for any thing they know, his Caſe and Circumſtances may come to be theirs.</p>
               <p>And thoſe that have loſt all ſenſe of good and evil, yet out of care to preſerve their credit amongſt Men (amongſt the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of whom, to be an honeſt Man will always ſignifie a great deal; for when all is done, it is impoſſible to extirpate the notions of Vertue and Honeſty out of the Minds of the Multitude:) I ſay, in point of their own credit and intereſt they are concern'd to be careful how they oppreſs ſuch a Man.</p>
               <p>But whatever become of theſe things; how ineffectual ſoever all humane means may be for the ſecuring and preſerving an Upright Man in evil times: Yet in the <hi>ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> place, he has another Auchor to ſtay himſelf upon, which is more firm and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and which will not fail him: and that is the protection of God Almighty: The care of his particular Providence to which he is intituled.</p>
               <p>Men may plot and deſign; may model and contrive; may order and manage things as they pleaſe: But when all is done it is God that governeth the World; and either blaſts their moſt fair and hopeful Projects; or if he ſuffers them to ſucceed, turns them to what uſe and purpoſes he
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:63712:104"/>pleaſes: Now this God that Rules and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth all things (even the moſt particular; <hi>For not a ſparrow doth fall to the ground without his will; and by him the very hairs of our head are numbred</hi>) This God hath engaged himſelf, to take care in an eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al manner, of thoſe that fear him, and walk Uprightly before him.</p>
               <p>He hath paſſed his Promiſe over and over again,<note place="margin">Pſal. 37. v. 6, 19, 24, 4<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

They ſhall not be confounded in the perilous time, and in the days of dearth they ſhall have enough.

               </p>
               <p>It would be endleſs to quote all the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages in the Book of God that ſpeak to this purpoſe. And therefore I ſhall diſmiſs this point with that remarkable one which we find in the Prophecy of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Cap. 15. v. 10.</note> wherein we may ſee, both the Upright Man, and his Security in evil times, deſcribed in ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry lively colours. <hi>He that walketh Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and ſpeaketh <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>prightly; He that deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth the gain of oppreſſions; that ſhaketh his hands from holding of bribes; that ſtoppeth
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:63712:104"/>his ears from hearing of blood; and ſhutteth his eyes from ſeeing evil: He ſhall dwell on high; his place of defence ſhall be the muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Rocks; his bread ſhall be given him, his water ſhall be ſure.</hi> The ſenſe of which in ſhort is this, That whoever walks Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightly, and makes a Conſcience of his ways: ſuch a Man ſhall be always under the watchful care and protection of the Divine Providence. And never will God ſuffer him to fall into any grievous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs; but he ſhall always have ſuch a por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the good things of this World af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded to him, as will be ſufficient not only to make his life ſupportable, but eaſy.</p>
               <p>And in truth, the experience of the World generally makes this good: Honeſt and Upright Men for the moſt part, in the moſt publick Calamities fare well; at leaſt much better than thoſe that are not ſo. In their greateſt extremities, when they have no proſpect of deliverance from any humane means, ſtrange extraordinary unexpected ſuccour and relief doth ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive to them. In a word, that care of the ſpecial Providence of God attends them, that they are never miſerable, however they may be now and then cut ſhort in their outward Fortunes.</p>
               <p>But it muſt be acknowledged, that though Piety and Uprightneſs hath the
<pb n="202" facs="tcp:63712:105"/>promiſe of ſecurity in this Life; and that promiſe for the moſt part, and in general ſpeaking is made good: Yet there are a great many exempt caſes. God may ſee it fit now and then to ſuffer an Upright Man to be oppreſt, and to periſh in a common ruin; and this without any violation of his promiſes of this kind, which do indeed reſpect no more than the ordinary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon events and ſucceſſes of things. But yet even in this caſe, ſtill there will <hi>To the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright ariſe Light in the Darkneſs;</hi> that is, <hi>Light</hi> in the third ſenſe we have given of the word, <hi>viz.</hi> taking <hi>Light</hi> for Peace and Joy and Comfort. And this is that which the Pſalmiſt tells us in another place, <hi>Light is ſown for the Righteous, and Gladneſs for the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright in heart.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 97.11.</note>
               </p>
               <p>Whatever Afflictions come upon the Upright Man, yet he hath this advantage of other Men, that he bears them infinite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly more lightly than they do; They are really no great diſturbance to him, for he enjoys the ſame calmneſs and ſerenity of Mind; the ſame peace and quiet and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment that ever he did.</p>
               <p>His preſent ſufferings are rather matter of rejoycing and triumph to him, than of diſcontent and repining; for he knows that they come upon him, by the Counſel and Diſpoſal of the great Governour of the World: And he knows that he hath
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:63712:105"/>ſo ſincerely approved himſelf to God, and is ſo well beloved by him; that he ſhould not have been ordered into theſe Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, had it not been really for his good. And this Conſideration doth ſo effectually ſupport him under all the Difficulties that he hath to conflict with, that he not only ſits down caſily and quietly, but is very well pleaſed with the diſpenſations of the Divine Providence towards him; how in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful ſoever they may be to Fleſh and Blood.</p>
               <p>Let what will happen to him, he is full of Peace and Joy. For he hath met with no diſappointment of his deſigns. His great aim was to pleaſe God; and his Conſcience from God's word aſſures him that he has done it; and he hath nothing to do farther but to wait for the happy time, when the ſecrets of all Hearts ſhall be revealed, and every Man's Counſels and Actions ſhall be made manifeſt, and then he doubts not to receive approbation and praiſe, and a great Reward in that Day of the Lord <hi>Jeſus.</hi> And ſo much the rather,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 4.17.</note>
                  <hi>becauſe this light affliction, wherewith he is now exerciſed,</hi> he is aſſured, <hi>will work for him a far more exceeding and eternal weight of Glory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To conclude, Whatever his ſufferings be; he will live and die in a profound Peace; perfectly ſatisfied with all God's

               <p>THE Parable of the Rich Man and <hi>Lazarus</hi> in the Goſpel is ſo well known, that it is needleſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the Particulars of it. Theſe Words are the Concluſion of that Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and they are made the Words of <hi>Abraham,</hi> who being in Paradiſe, is brought in as ſpeaking them to the Rich Man in Hell.</p>
               <pb n="206" facs="tcp:63712:107"/>
               <p>The Occaſion was this. This now Poor Man not being able to obtain the leaſt Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort or Refreſhment for himſelf under that unſupportable anguiſh he endured; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thinks himſelf of his Friends and Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in the World, and caſts about how to prevent their coming to that ſad condition. And for this purpoſe, he begs of <hi>Abraham</hi> that he would be pleaſed to ſend the happy <hi>Lazarus</hi> into the World again, to teſtifie to his Brethren what he knew and had ſeen concerning the State of the other Life; and to exhort them to a timely Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, leſt they ſhould come into that place of Torment in which he was.</p>
               <p>To this Requeſt, <hi>Abraham</hi> thus anſwers. <hi>They had Moſes and the Prophets,</hi> which did plainly enough teſtifie againſt their Sins, and offered ſufficient Motives to them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent; and therefore there was no need of ſuch extraordinary Means as he deſired.</p>
               <p>But this Anſwer did not ſatisfie the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable Man. Still he purſues his former Requeſt. <hi>Nay, Father Abraham,</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>but if one went unto them from the dead, they will repent.</hi> There was no reſiſting ſuch an Argument as that. If <hi>Lazarus</hi> whom they all had known living, and now knew to be dead, ſhould riſe again, and perſonally come to them, and tell them in what a ſad condition he had ſeen their Friend, and that they muſt all expect to run
<pb n="207" facs="tcp:63712:107"/>the ſame Fortune, if they did not change their Courſe of Living: This would come cloſe to them, and be more convincing than a hundred Arguments drawn from the Books of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, which were written many Ages before their time, and ſo conſequently could not be preſumed to have ſo great a force as an Argument drawn from their own Senſe and Experience.</p>
               <p>To this Reply of the Rich Man, <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham</hi> peremptorily rejoyns in the Words of the Text. <hi>If they hear not Moſes and the Prophets, neither will they be perſuaded though one roſe from the dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To omit leſſer Matters that may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from theſe Words; the Point which primarily, and moſt naturally ſeems to be offered to our Conſideration from them, is this. <hi>That thoſe who give no credit to a ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſtanding Revelation of God once well at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tested, or are not thereby prevailed upon to reform their Evil manners; neither in all probability would they be prevailed upon, though a particular Miracle was wrought by God in order to their Converſion; as, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, though one ſhould riſe from the dead and appear to them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to ſatisfie every one of the Truth of this Propoſition, it will be abundantly ſufficient to make out theſe two things.</p>
               <pb n="208" facs="tcp:63712:108"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> That there is really more force and weight in a Publick ſtanding Revelation of God, ſuch as that was by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets here mentioned, to convince Men, or to reclaim them; than there can be in a Private Miracle, though I ſee it with my Eyes.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Secondly,</hi> Though God ſhould be pleaſed to work a Miracle, or to ſend an Apparition for the Conviction of an obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Unbeliever, or vicious Perſon; yet ſuch a one would as eaſily find out ſhifts and ways to evade the force of ſuch an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument, and to hinder the Effect it ought have upon him, as he formerly did to put off the ordinary ſtanding Motives and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments of Religion: And conſequently, there is little probability, that he who is not gained by the former, will be wrought upon by the latter.</p>
               <p>I begin with the firſt of theſe things. <hi>That there is really more force and weight in a Publick ſtanding Revelation of God, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince Men, or to reclaim them; than there can be ſuppoſed to be in a Private ſingle Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, though a Man ſees it with his Eyes: Or, than there can be in an Apparition from the dead, if God ſhould think fit to vouchſafe ſuch a thing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In ſpeaking to this, I mean not to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern my ſelf or you with the Revelati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, though that
<pb n="209" facs="tcp:63712:108"/>be the Revelation which the Text here ſpeaks of. I think it will be more ſuitable and uſeful to us to conſider the Propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with relation to Chriſtianity, or the Revelation of our Saviour and his Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles: That being the Diſpenſation we are now under, and in which we are more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately concerned.</p>
               <p>Underſtanding therefore our Propoſition of that Eſpecial Revelation which we call the Goſpel, two things there are to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, which will undeniably make it out.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> Thoſe Perſons that lived in the Times of our Saviour, when this Publick Revelation of the Goſpel was made and atteſted, had greater Evidences and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to bring them over to the Belief and Practice of his Religion; than if any parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Miracle had been wrought in order to their Converſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We at this day, all things conſidered, have as ſtrong Arguments to convince us, as powerful Motives to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade us, as thoſe that lived in the Times of our Saviour, and were Witneſſes of what he did and taught.</p>
               <p>The unavoidable Conſequences of which two Points are theſe. That thoſe who li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in the time of our Saviour, and were not perſuaded by his Goſpel, would not have been perſuaded though one had been ſent to them from the dead. And thoſe they
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:63712:109"/>are now alive, and are not perſuaded by the Evidences and Motives of Chriſtianity which we now have among us, would not have been perſuaded if they had lived in the Times of our Saviour. So that in all Ages of Chriſtianity the Propoſition will hold true, That thoſe who give no credit to the ſtanding Revelation of the Goſpel, or are not thereby induced to lead their Lives according to it; would not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon though a particular Miracle was wrought for their Converſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt</hi> then, <hi>Our Saviour's Goſpel at the firſt publiſhing of it was a more effectual Means for the Converſion of any Man then living, than the ſending to him one from the dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us ſuppoſe the Parable we are now upon, to be a true Hiſtory, and that this Rich Man had five Brethren living at <hi>Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem</hi> at the time when our Saviour ſpoke it; and they were all Wicked, Lewd, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theiſtical Perſons; and God Almighty, in pity to their Souls, is pleaſed to grant that Requeſt which the Rich Man here makes to <hi>Abraham</hi> on their behalf; and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly ſends <hi>Lazarus</hi> from the dead to preach Repentance to them: We cannot doubt but ſuch a Sermon, from ſuch a Man, and in ſuch Circumſtances, would mightily awaken them, and put them up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a more ſerious Conſideration of the folly of their Ways, and the danger they
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:63712:109"/>expoſed them to, than ever they entered in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to before; and this Conſideration it is like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly might work them to ſerious Reſolutions of quitting their preſent Courſes, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring upon a ſtricter Life. Certainly ſuch an Apparition as this, in reaſon ſhould work ſuch Effects; and, without doubt, upon many it would. But this we ſay. Whether did not our Saviour perform a great deal more than all this comes to, in order to the Conviction and Converſion of all about him? And whether had not theſe five Brethren, ſuppoſing them to live when he preached his Goſpel, and to be Witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of his Actions, much more reaſon to be perſuaded by what he did, and taught; than by the aforeſaid Viſion?</p>
               <p>Our Saviour did by all the Signs and Tokens in the World evidence himſelf to be an Expreſs Meſſenger ſent from God, which they could not be certain that the Viſion was.</p>
               <p>The Prophetick Records of their own Country did all teſtifie of him; and they themſelves by comparing his Life and them together, might ſee they were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled in him.</p>
               <p>To omit the Circumſtances of his Birth, which were ſuch as never any beſides him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf was born with; After he came to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter upon his Publick Employment, God did more than once by a Voice from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="212" facs="tcp:63712:110"/>teſtifie, that he had ſent him, and that all People were to hearken to him.</p>
               <p>And the Truth of this he himſelf confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, not only by his Life, which was the moſt Innocent, and Vertuous, and God-like that ever was: Nor only by his Sermons and Doctrines, which were the moſt Perfect and Unexceptionable, and every way the moſt worthy of God, that ever were taught among Men: But alſo and moſt chiefly by his extraordinary Works, which were ſuch as none but God, or one acted by a Divine Power, could poſſibly perform.</p>
               <p>He did the greateſt things that ever were ſeen by Men. He ſhewed by his Actions, and thoſe moſt publickly done, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently repeated, that he had an abſolute Sovereign Power over the courſe of Nature: over the inviſible Agents of this World, as well Angels as Devils: And likewiſe over both the Bodies and the Souls of Men.</p>
               <p>And particularly to make it appear that his Teſtimony was more authentick, his Authority more to be relied on, than that of any Ghoſt, any <hi>Lazarus</hi> whatſoever that ſhould riſe from the Dead: It was very uſual with him to ſend again to the Living theſe that were once dead. And one <hi>Lazarus</hi> he really brought again from the Boſom of <hi>Abraham,</hi> after he had been four days Dead, to teſtifie to the World that <hi>J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſus</hi> was the Great Embaſſador that God
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:63712:110"/>had ſent, and that all Mankind were to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and obey him.</p>
               <p>And leſt all this ſhould not be convincing enough; leſt it ſhould be ſaid ſtill, One that ſhould riſe from the dead, and come and preach to us, would leave the greater Impreſſions upon us: <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf did riſe from the dead, and did come and preach to the World, and that in a far more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing manner than the Ghoſt of <hi>Lazarus</hi> would have done, if the Rich Man had had his own Wiſh. For <hi>Jeſus</hi> told his own Death before-hand, and fore-told alſo his Reſurrection; And if God meant not to lay an invincible Temptation before Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind to believe a Falſhood, it had concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Providence to have hindred this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, if <hi>Jeſus</hi> had been any thing elſe than what he pretended to be: But he did riſe after three days, according to his Prediction, and converſed upon Earth with his Followers for forty days together; ſhewing himſelf not only to a few particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Diſciples, but to great Crowds of them, Five hundred at a time. And after this, in the ſight of his Friends he took his leave of the World, and aſcended up into Heaven. And for a Teſtimony how God approved him there, he ſent down the Holy Spirit upon his Diſciples, who for many years together enabled them to do our Saviour's Miracles over again, in confirmation of his Doctrine.</p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:63712:111"/>
               <p>If now, to come to our Argument; if theſe five Brethren of the Rich Man be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be alive when all theſe things came to paſs; If they had the Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of being preſent at many of theſe Paſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and of ſatisfying themſelves of the reſt, (as certainly, ſuppoſing the Matter of Fact to be true, none that lived at that time, and in that Country, but had this Opportunity;) If they heard this <hi>Jeſus</hi> that was ſent from God at the firſt, and that was ſent from God the ſecond time, after he was dead, teſtifying againſt their Sins, forewarning them of the Judgment to come, and aſſuring them of Eternal Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards if they would repent: I ſay, If they were Witneſſes of theſe things, I will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to all the World, whether they had not greater Means of Conviction offered to them, than if any Ghoſt had appeared to them from the Dead; or any particular Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle had been vouchſafed them for the bringing them over to Vertue and Sobriety.</p>
               <p>But I believe no Body will much doubt of this; for indeed the matter will not bear a diſpute. But here is the Queſtion; Whether we that live at this diſtance from our Saviour, have the ſame Means of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction? and, Whether one now appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the dead to us, would not be of greater force to perſuade us, than the ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Revelation of the Goſpel, as we have it now conveyed to us?</p>
               <pb n="215" facs="tcp:63712:111"/>
               <p>This therefore leads me to my <hi>ſecond</hi> Propoſition upon this Head, which if it can be made out, will wholly take away all Controverſie in this Matter. And it is this:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>That we at this day have as great Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to convince us of the Truth of Chriſt's Revelation, and conſequently as great Motives from thence to perſuade us to reform our Evil Lives, as thoſe that Lived in the Times of our Saviour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is true indeed, we want the Evidence of Senſe in theſe Matters, which they had; and upon that account, it muſt be acknowledged, that they have the Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of us. But this we ſay, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, that if we take all things toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and weigh them Impartially, we ſhall find that that Want is abundantly ſuppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us in other reſpects.</p>
               <p>For <hi>firſt</hi> of all, Our Saviour's Goſpel, and all the Evidences of it I have been now ſpeaking of, were timely and faithfully re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded, and are as faithfully tranſmitted down to us. So that though we did not ſee or hear thoſe things, yet we have a certain and exact Account of them; and ſuch an Account as was never yet queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any Adverſaries that lived in thoſe Times, when ſuch a Queſtion was moſt reaſonably to be made; and ſuch an Account as appears by all the Evidences that a thing of that Nature is capable of, to have been
<pb n="216" facs="tcp:63712:112"/>written by Eye-witneſſes and ſuch Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes as were honeſt undeſigning Men; and not only ſo, but they ſealed with their Blood the Truth of what they reported. And this ſame Account was religiouſly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by all Chriſtians, in all Places, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Contradiction in thoſe very Times, and was ſhortly after tranſlated into a Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of Languages, ſo that it is ſcarce poſſible it ſhould in any Conſiderable Matter be corrupted. And from that Time to this, in a continual Succeſſion, there have been Men that have ſuffer'd Martyrdom for the Atteſtation of it; and in the firſt Ages after <hi>Chriſt,</hi> when they had the beſt Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Examining the Truth of theſe things, many thouſands did ſo.</p>
               <p>Now I ſay, Though acccording to the Ordinary Proverb, <hi>Seeing be Believing:</hi> Yet next to Seeing, an univerſal, well-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Tradition, which hath viſible Effects at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending it, hath the moſt force to gain belief. Nay, I do not know whether there be ſo much Difference between the Evidence of the one and the other, as one would think at firſt. Sure I am, there are many Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in which we do as firmly believe Matters of Fact upon the Credit of Tradition, and the permanent Effects that do accompany it, as if we our ſelves had been preſent, and ſeen them with our Eyes. Which of us, for Inſtance, doth make any more doubt of
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:63712:112"/>the Story of <hi>William</hi> the Conquerour his ſubduing this Kingdom, or of <hi>Henry</hi> the Eighth his caſting off the Pope's Suprema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; than he doth of the Revolutions that have happned in his own time? And yet theſe Matters of Fact are no better atteſted than the Hiſtory of our Saviour, and his Miracles and Doctrines,</p>
               <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> Though thoſe that lived in our Saviour's time had Evidence of Senſe for the Truth of what they believed concerning him and his Doctrine, which we have not: Yet this is to be conſidered; that they laboured under far greater Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judices againſt his Religion, than we now do, And conſequently, all that ſenſible Proof which they had of the Truth of it, would not be more effectual for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing of them; than that Proof we now have, though it be leſs, ought in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to be for the convincing of us.</p>
               <p>They that were the Hearers and Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of what our Saviour ſaid and did, had mighty and inveterate Prepoſſeſſions to ſtruggle with. They were educated in a quite Different Religion, and ſo muſt be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have entertained ſeveral Notions and Principles which would very difficultly be rooted out; and indeed, for the effecting of it there needed little leſs than an Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power. But it is not ſo with us; we by our Education are already diſpoſed
<pb n="218" facs="tcp:63712:113"/>and prepared for the receiving Chriſtianity. We have no praevious Engagements to alienate our Minds from it; nay, it is our Intereſt to be of that Religion, rather than any other. So that certainly a leſs Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence for the Truth of it, will be as con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>vincing to us, as a much greater would have been to thoſe to whom our Saviour firſt Preached. Nay, I am very confident that this thing being duely conſidered, it will appear, that our Arguments for Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty drawn from Tradition, will be more convincing to thinking Men among us, than thoſe Arguments they had from Senſe and Experience could be to them.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Thirdly,</hi> If to what hath been ſaid we add the ſeveral Arguments for the Credibility of the Chriſtian Religion which we now have at this diſtance, that they had not nor could have, that were our Saviour's Immediate Diſciples; we ſhall be ſatisfied that in point of Evidence we have indeed much the advantage of them. We have now ſeveral ſtanding proofs of our Religion which they could not have; and which are ſo ſtrong and concluſive, that they do more than compenſate for the want of that Evidence of Senſe which they had, and we have not. I breifly Inſtance in theſe three following.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> The ſtrange Propagation and Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of our Religion throughout the World
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:63712:113"/>and the Means by which it was Effected. That a poor deſpiſed crucified Perſon ſhould in a few Years draw all the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire after him; and that without any viſible Means, except the Goodneſs of his Cauſe, and the Reaſonableneſs of his Doctrine, and the Sincerity and Conſtancy of his Diſciples, not in fighting for their Maſter, but in laying down their Lives for him: And this againſt all the Power, and all the Arts and Stratagems that the Devil or the Princes of this World could invent to ſtifle and ſuppreſs his Name: This is ſo ſtrong an Argument that this Cauſe was the Cauſe of God, and that his Providence was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly concerned in the promoting of it, that he muſt ſeem little to be ſenſible either of God or Providence, that is not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced by it.</p>
               <p>If Chriſtianity had been of the ſame ſtrain that the Religion of <hi>Mahomet</hi> is, had been as well calculated for Mens Luſts and World<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Intereſts as that is; had allowed as many ſenſual Liberties to its Diſciples as that doth; and laſtly, had been carried on in the World by the ſame ways and means that that hath been, that is by the Force of Arms and Dint of the Sword; it would have been no great wonder that it ſhould have prevailed, as we ſee it hath done. But that a Religion which had no Worldly Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages to promiſe to its Followers; Nay on
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:63712:114"/>the contrary, was ſo contrived, that none could own it, but he muſt at the ſame time deny all his Temporal Intereſts, quit his Friends, his Reputation, and all his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes in this World, and live in hourly expectation of a Martyrdom; that ſuch a Religion as this ſhould not only not die with the firſt Broachers of it, but daily grow and ſpread; and the more it was perſecuted, the more increaſe; till at laſt it ſo weathered out all Oppoſition, that it got Poſſeſſion of the Thrones of Princes, and Kings became Nurſing Fathers to it: I ſay, Whoever is not convinced that the Finger of God was in this, would ſcarce have been convinced that the Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of God was in our Saviour's Miracles, had he been alive and preſent when they were done. But this Effect of Chriſtianity both the Prophets and our Lord long ago foretold, and this we now ſee was verified long ago, and is ſtill verified in our days: Though thoſe that lived with our Saviour had no experience hereof, nor perhaps would ſeveral of them have been forward to believe it though it had been told them. So that in this reſpect we have a moſt Conſiderable Argument for our Religion, which they had not.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> This is not all. Thoſe that undertook the Religion of our Saviour upon <hi>his</hi> Preaching, had no Experience of
<pb n="221" facs="tcp:63712:114"/>it: They were to be the firſt Experimenters themſelves. They ran a great Riſque, and ventured the Sale of all that they had, and yet knew not ſo certainly what kind of Treaſure they ſhould Purchaſe. But we have the Experience and Suffrage of Sixteen Ages, which will all vouch, that what we lay out in this way will prove valuable Treaſure, will Reward all the Pains and all the Expence we are at for the Purchaſing of it. We have never in the compaſs of our own knowledge, nor in all Hiſtory, met with any who ſeriouſly laid out themſelves in the Service of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and lived up to his Religion, that ever grudged the Pains they took about it, or repented themſelves that they believed or practiſed as they did. The more any Man has been a Chriſtian, ſtill the more he hath thanked God for it; ſtill the more Quiet of Mind and Peace of Conſcience he hath poſſeſſed; the more he hath enjoyed him ſelf, and the leſs he hath feared Death and all other outward Calamities. If ever any Chriſtian hath repented of any thing, it is, that he hath not been Chriſtian enough, that he hath not ſo heartily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in our Saviour, and obeyed his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts as he ſhould have done. This we all know, and muſt be ſenſible of; and it is a mighty Evidence of the Truth and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Religion we profeſs. We
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:63712:115"/>now can try our Religion, and give our Approbation of it, by the ſame Standard and Meaſures, by which we try and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of our Cuſtoms and Common Laws. After long experience we find the Uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and the Conveniency of it; and to put another in its place, would involve us in horrible Miſchiefs, and Dangers, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexities. But this Argument for Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, thoſe that were the firſt Converts to it could not have, and therefore in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect alſo we have the advantage of them.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly and Laſtly,</hi> There is another very Conſiderable ſtanding Argument for the Truth of the Chriſtian Revelation, which thoſe in our Saviour's Time were uncapable of; and that is, the Events which he by the Spirit of Prophecy fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told ſhould after his Death come to paſs in the World; moſt of which have punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally hapned as he predicted them, and the reſt in due time we doubt not will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhed. I have not leiſure to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute this Argument particularly; only two things I cannot paſs by without mention, in both of which our Lord ſhewed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as wonderful, and as true a Prophet as ever appeared in the World.</p>
               <p>The one is, the Deſtruction of <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> and the Temple, which he foretold with all the Circumſtances imaginable, both as to Time and Manner. Now all that he
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:63712:115"/>ſaid concerning that Deſtruction, was pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually verified, even according to the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts that the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Hiſtorian gives us of that Matter, And when afterwards <hi>Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi> the Emperour, with a deſign to blaſt the Credit of our Saviour's Prophecy, reſolved to re-edifie that Temple, and ſet Men on work for that purpoſe; he was ſoon forced to deſiſt from his Enterpriſe, by Earthquakes, and Globes of Fire iſſuing from out of the Foundations: As the Writers of that time, both Chriſtian and Pagan, do aſſure us.</p>
               <p>The other Inſtance I mention is, our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's Prophecy of the Rejection of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and that they ſhould be <hi>carried Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive into all Nations till the Times of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles were fulfilled.</hi> Now this we ſee hath been accompliſhed for many Ages, and ſtill continues to be ſo in our days. That Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Jews</hi> who were once the Pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar People of God, ſettled in the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> by his own immediate Hand, are now diſperſed all the World over, but no where incorporated into a Nation. Yet, which indeed is wonderful, they continue <hi>Jews</hi> ſtill; a People that mingle not with the reſt of the World, and that are ſtill as zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous for the Scriptures, from whence we fetch the Grounds of our Chriſtianity, as ever they were. So that they are a ſtanding Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of God's Vengeance upon a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple for rejecting the Goſpel, and a ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:63712:116"/>Teſtimony of the Truth of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our's Prophecies.</p>
               <p>Theſe things now, with others that I might name, are very conſiderable Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of the Truth of our Religion, which thoſe that were Contemporary with our Saviour could not have. So that putting all theſe things together, I think we may ſafely draw our Concluſion, <hi>viz.</hi> That we now have as great or greater Arguments to convince us of the Truth of Chriſt's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, as, or than they had who were Witneſſes of what he did and taught. And conſequently, thoſe that are not perſuaded now by the Evidence of it, would not have been perſuaded though they had ſeen with their Eyes, or heard with their Ears, the Publication of the Goſpel: Which is in effect to ſay, They would not have been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded though one had riſen from the dead.</p>
               <p>But notwithſtanding all this that I have ſaid, it is to be feared the thing will not ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſily go down with many of us; but ſtill, with the Rich Man in the Parable, after all that <hi>Abraham</hi> had ſaid concerning <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes</hi> and the Prophets, we will inſiſt on our former Notion. <hi>Nay, but if one came to us from the Dead, we ſhould repent.</hi> The Motives that are offered to us in the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel are old and ſtale to us, we find by long experience, that they make no great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions upon us: But if we were viſited
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:63712:116"/>in ſuch an extraordinary way as the Rich Man here deſired for his Brethren, we ſhould then undoubtedly be prevailed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Thus I believe ſeveral of us think: But that we have little ground for ſuch a fancy; nay, indeed, if we were tried in this way, that it is ten to one, we ſhould find our ſelves miſtaken; this may farther convince us, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>If God ſhould indeed vouchſafe to work a Miracle, or to ſend an Apparition for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of an Obſtinate <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbeliever, or vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perſon: Yet ſuch a one would as eaſily find out ſhifts and ways to evade the force of ſuch an Argument, and to hinder the effects it ought to have upon him, as he formerly did to put off the ſtanding Motives and Arguments of Religion. And conſequently, there is lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle probability that he who is deaf to</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets, will be perſuaded by one from the dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the <hi>ſecond</hi> Point I laid down for the proof of our Saviour's Propoſition, and I come now to ſpeak to it.</p>
               <p>I deny not indeed, but if an Apparition ſhould be made to a wicked Perſon among us: If, for inſtance, One of our Compani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons ſhould, after he is dead, in a terrible manner come to any of us, and in a dole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful tone and language tell us, how it goes with him in the other World; tell us, that there is indeed a God that judges the Earth,
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:63712:117"/>that there is a Heaven, that there is a Hell, (all which things he as well as we made it our buſineſs to baniſh out of our Minds as much as we could;) and acquaint us what an infinite unſpeakable Happineſs he hath loſt by living looſely and careleſly, as we now do; and that he is damned, irrecove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rably and for ever damned for that Infideli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and thoſe lewd courſes we ſhared with him in the guilt of, and do ſtill continue to purſue; that all thoſe Revels we had to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, all thoſe Pranks and Debauches we were joint Actors in, do now, as to him, end in unſupportable anguiſh and pains, in the gnawings of a Worm that never dies, and in a life of everlaſting Burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings; and that this ſhall certainly be our portion, as well as his, unleſs we do prevent it by a ſpeedy reformation of our Lives:</p>
               <p>I ſay, If one of our Friends ſhould come from the Dead, and tell us all this, there is no doubt but it would ſtrike us with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite horrour and amazement. It would be the moſt confounding Scene that ever our Eyes beheld, the moſt awakening Lecture that ever our Ears heard, and ſuch impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions it would, in all likelihood, make up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, as would not ſuddenly be worn out.</p>
               <p>But here is the point, Whether all this would be effectual for the working a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Change of Life, a laſting Reformation,
<pb n="227" facs="tcp:63712:117"/>upon a Man that hath long reſiſted the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary means of Converſion, and by long cuſtom of ſinning hath made a courſe of Vice almoſt natural to him? We ſay, in all probability it would not be effectual for the reforming ſuch a Man; becauſe it would be ſo eaſie after the firſt Heats which the Viſion occaſioned were over, to find out colourable excuſes, and evaſions why he ſhould not purſue a Reformation, which his Soul ſo much hated, and which his preſent Intereſts and Appetites were ſo much againſt.</p>
               <p>For, <hi>firſt</hi> of all, Though he was never ſo ſenſibly ſmit at the firſt; yet after a little time, the infinite love he bears to that courſe of life which this Viſion came to teſtifie againſt, would put him upon Inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the rendring the credit of his ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Senſes doubtful and ſuſpected. Many Reaſons would be ſuggeſted to him from his bribed Underſtanding, why he ſhould not in this caſe believe his own Eyes. For why might not all this be a mere deluſion, the effects of a Melancholy diſtempered Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, a Buſineſs wholly tranſacted on the Stage of his Imagination.</p>
               <p>That he had ſuch an Apparition, and that he was horribly frighted with it, he cannot doubt: But whether this Apparition was really preſented to his outward Senſes, and was not only the Fiction of his own
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:63712:118"/>heated and diſturbed Brain, he thinks he hath reaſon to doubt.</p>
               <p>For he remembers, that even in Dreams things have been as livelily repreſented to him, and made as great Impreſſions on him, as the ſame things could have been or done if he had been awake. And he knows very well, that Fancy hath a ſtrange power over a Man's Judgment, even when his Eyes are wide open; eſpecially if the circumſtances of being alone, of Melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly and Penſiveneſs, and ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Accidents do concur to the raiſing of it.</p>
               <p>How many People meet with Goblins in their Night-walks, and ſee Armies fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the Air, and aſſuredly perſuade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others that they do ſo? When as in truth the one is nothing elſe but Trees; and the other, but Clouds formed into ſuch ſhapes by the power of their Imagination. How many Perſons in Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veriſh Diſtempers ſee plainly Fiends and Devils ſtanding at their Beds-feet, ready to take them away, and hear dreadful Noi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes? But yet none is ſo ſimple as to believe theſe to be Realties, but only the Effects of their preſent Frenzy. And why may not this Bugbear of a Viſion, that did at firſt ſo fright the Man, be a thing of the ſame kind, a mere Creature of his own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordered Fancy?</p>
               <pb n="229" facs="tcp:63712:118"/>
               <p>It is certainly not impoſſible for a Man, whoſe concernment it is not to believe any thing of this nature, at laſt to bring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to ſuch an Opinion.</p>
               <p>Eſpecially when he is helped forward by the concurrent Votes of all his jolly Companions, whom he tells the thing to; who, to be ſure, will not fail to laugh heartily, and make very merry with his Story; and, if it be poſſible, to droll it out of his Head, by perſuading him, that the whole Matter was but the Reſult of Melancholy and a crazed Brain; and that if he ſtill continues to believe it, he is ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for <hi>Bedlam</hi> than their Company.</p>
               <p>But <hi>ſecondly,</hi> Suppoſing he cannot thus eaſily baffle the Credit of his Senſes; but is forced to believe, that what he ſaw and heard was more than a Fancy or Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: Yet that inveterate Principle of Vice within him will put him upon other ways and contrivances for the hindring that Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect which the Viſion ought in reaſon to have upon him. Though he cannot que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion the Truth of the Matter of Fact; yet it is likely he may queſtion the Force of the Argument drawn from thence for his Conviction.</p>
               <p>Here is one pretends to come to him from the Dead; but how ſhall he be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that he did really come from thence? For any thing he knows, it may be ſome
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:63712:119"/>Trick put upon him. Some knaviſh Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low had a mind to fright him, or ſome bigotted Religioniſt, aſſuming the Perſon or a Ghoſt, thought by this pious Fraud to convert him to his Perſuaſion; as he hath read in Story, ſuch Pranks have been plaid to ſerve a Turn, or promote a good Cauſe. And whereas his Reaſon might tell him, that this could not be ſo, ſeeing the Perſon that appeared to him had both the Countenance and the Voice of his Friend, yet that he would get over; the Impoſture was cunningly carried on, and the Surpriſe and Fright it put him into, did ſo diſorder his Judgment that he was not able to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh between the True and the Counterfeit.</p>
               <p>But ſuppoſing he be convinced, that here was no Juggle in the matter, but what appeared was a true Spirit or a Ghoſt, if there be any ſuch: Yet how ſhall he know that it was the Ghoſt of his Friend? If he was ſure it was he, he would give credit to what he reported, becauſe of the former experience he had had of his inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity: But this he cannot any way be cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of. For any thing he knows to the contrary, it may be one of thoſe ill-natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red Inhabitants of the Air, that are ſo much talked of, that make it their Buſineſs to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturb the Reſt and Quiet of Mankind; and take a pleaſure in filling their Heads with Fears and Scruples, and drawing them to all kind of Superſtition.</p>
               <pb n="231" facs="tcp:63712:119"/>
               <p>He hath heard and read of ſuch: And there is no Man of any Perſuaſion or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, <hi>Jew, Turk,</hi> or <hi>Heathen;</hi> nay, all the ſeveral ſorts of Heathens at this day, which are to be found either in the <hi>Eaſt</hi> or the <hi>Weſtern Indies;</hi> and <hi>Chriſtians</hi> too of all Communions: There is none of theſe but have Stories to tell of Apparitions and Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, for the confirmation of their ſeveral Doctrines and Tenents. Now that all theſe Apparitions are to have Credit given to them, is abſurd; becauſe they contradict one another in their Diſcoveries. How therefore can he tell whether this particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Apparition that is made to him, ought to be credited or no, as to what it declares concerning Religion, and the State of the other World? In plain <hi>Engliſh,</hi> rather than ſuch a Man as we are ſpeaking of, will be prevailed upon to quit his dearly-beloved Luſts and Vices, he will find Excuſes and Reaſons a great many, why he ought not to believe any thing that is conveyed to him in ſuch a manner as we now ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe.</p>
               <p>Eſpecially, if we conſider, in the <hi>Third</hi> place, What Advantages he will make for his purpoſe from that very Way that we now think would be moſt effectual to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert him; that is, <hi>One coming from the Dead.</hi> Here is an Apparition pretends to be ſent upon a particular Meſſage to him
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:63712:120"/>from the other World, to perſuade him to embrace ſuch a Religion, and to change his way of Living; and threatens him with horrible Puniſhments of he doth not: The very unuſualneſs of the thing will put ſome Apprehenſions into him, (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially conſidering his concernment to find out all the ways that can be, to elude the Force of the Argument) that it is not ſo convincing, doth not carry in it ſo great Evidence as at firſt ſight there ſeemed to appear. For what Imaginable Reaſon can be given why he ſhould be dealt with in a way ſo different from that that the reſt of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are? The Particularity of the Miracle will give occaſion to him to ſuſpect the Truth of what it diſcovers. If his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and Friends were thus haunted, he might think he had reaſon to be alarmed, and to apprehend ſome danger in that Courſe of Life he is ſo much diſuaded from: But ſince none in the place where he lives, is thus exerciſed beſides himſelf; he cannot ſatisfie his Reaſon, as to this way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding with him. If this Means of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction was rational and ſtrong, without doubt others would have it afforded to them, and be convinced by it as well as he. But ſince no ſuch thing appears, as the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition it ſelf is unaccountable, ſo are the Arguments and Motives it offers, unaccount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able alſo. And till he be convinced in the
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:63712:120"/>ſame way, and by the ſame Reaſons that other Men are, he will continue as he is.</p>
               <p>I repreſent theſe things, not to ſhew the weakneſs or invalidity of ſuch an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as we are ſpeaking of, but to ſhew how eaſily thoſe that have eſpouſed In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts inconſiſtent with Religion and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity may find out Expedients for the avoiding the Force of it.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and Laſtly, Let all this go for nothing. Let us ſuppoſe the Man to be very well ſatisfied in his own Mind, both concerning the matter of Fact, and the cogency of the Argument he hath from thence, to live after another rate than he hath hitherto done; Nay, as often as he thinks of this Viſion, or is asked concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, he hath the ſame Senſe, and makes the ſame Judgment of it that he did at firſt; though it be many Years after: I ſay, ſuppoſing all this, yet doth it from hence follow, That ſuch a Man will be effectually brought over to Vertue and Religion, after he hath long purſued a courſe of ſin, and reſiſted the Arguments of the Goſpel? Alas it is very unlikely. How much alarmed ſoever he was at firſt, yet it is a hundred to one (if he be ſuch a Perſon as we ſpeak of) but in time, and by degrees the Impreſſions will wear off, and Nature return to its firſt Courſe. It was the newneſs and ſurprizingneſs of the
<pb n="234" facs="tcp:63712:121"/>thing, that firſt wrought upon him; but that will not laſt always. After he hath once got over the firſt Tranſports, and is come again to his uſual temper, and to his Buſineſs, and to his Company; the Argument, though it have the ſame Force that it had at firſt, yet it grows flat and unaffecting, and will have no more effect upon him than the ſtanding Motives of Chriſtianity formerly had. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all his firſt Convictions, he will live as tamely under the Bondage and Tyranny of his old reigning Luſts (though perhaps not without ſome checks of Conſcience now and then,) as thoſe that never had ſuch kind of means vouchſafed them for their Converſion.</p>
               <p>And it muſt needs be thus; for when all is done, Arguments will ſtill be but Arguments. They can perſuade, but they cannot compel. The efficacy of them doth in a great Meaſure depend upon our Will and Choice, eſpecially where they are to combate with ſtrong Paſſions and Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſeſſions.</p>
               <p>Are there not a thouſand Perſons in our days, that are as fully convinced of the Truth of the Chriſtian Revelation, and the Neceſſity of a Holy Religious Life in order to the going to Heaven, or avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Pains of Hell, as they would be if one ſhould come to them from the Dead?
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:63712:121"/>Nay, more fully, perhaps, than they would have been by the Teſtimony of ſuch an Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parition had they wanted the Scriptures. And have not the Conſciences of theſe Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons at ſeveral times by ſeveral means been ſeverely awakened? And have they not at theſe ſeaſons in the moſt ſerious manner imaginable made Vows and Reſolutions to live a Holy Chriſtian Life? And yet we ſee they continue ſtill unreformed, ſtill they are the ſame ſenſual, careleſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian Livers that ever they were. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Conſciences of Men, whether this be not true; and why ſhould we think it would fare otherwiſe with us, if God ſhould ſend one from the Dead to reclaim us? That very Miracle would not convince our Underſtandings more then they have been convinced already; and therefore why ſhould we think it would work more upon our Wills?</p>
               <p>The Sum of all this Diſcourſe is this. That how prevaling ſoever we may ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine ſuch an experiment, as the Rich Man here offers to <hi>Abraham</hi> for the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion of his Brethren, would be upon us, yet a ſenſual Man, that was unwilling to give up himſelf to the Conduct of Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, might eaſily find out ways to avoid the Force that it ought to have upon his Mind; Nay, more eaſily perhaps than he hath hitherto reſiſted the Motives of the
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:63712:122"/>Goſpel. And therefore we may certainly conclude with <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Text, that they <hi>that hear not</hi> Moſes <hi>and the Prophets,</hi> or to put it into our own Language, they that hear not Chriſt and his Apoſtles, <hi>neither,</hi> in all probability, <hi>would they be perſuaded though one roſe from the Dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nothing now remains, but that I draw two or three Inferences from what hath been ſaid, and ſo conclude.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>firſt</hi> place, From what I have diſcourſed upon this Argument, we may diſcover the Infinite Wiſdom of God, in the pitching upon that Method he hath done, for the bringing Men to Vertue and Happineſs; namely, by the ſtanding Revelations of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, and of Chriſt and his Apoſtles. For we may perceive this Method is every way more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodated for that End, than if God ſhould be every day working Miracles for the reclaiming particular Perſons.</p>
               <p>As it is more ſuitable to the other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of God's Providence; to the way that he hath choſen for the Government of the World, (which is by the ſetled ſtanding Laws of Motion, leaving Natural Cauſes to produce their Natural Effects, and not interpoſing his Omnipotency, but upon eſpecial extraordinary Occaſions:) So alſo as we have ſeen, is it much more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual for the covincing, Mens Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings,
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:63712:122"/>and the working upon their Wills, than the other Method of Private Miracles and Revelations would be.</p>
               <p>We have ſeen how many ways the Force of an Argument drawn from ones appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from the Dead may be evaded: But now none of theſe Pretences can be made againſt the Evidence of a Publick Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, ſo atteſted, and confirmed, and conveyed down to us, as that of Chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is. And beſides, there are many Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to be drawn from ſuch a Revelation, to ſhew the Credebility of it, which are altogether wanting to ſuch a Private Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle as we ſpeak of.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> We may learn from hence, what little need there is of any new modern Miracles for the confirming to us any Doctrine of Chriſtianity, which was long ago, in all the Articles of it, ſo well at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted by the Illuſtrious Miracles of Chriſt and his Apoſtles.</p>
               <p>And more eſpecially we may learn from hence what little Credit is to be given to thoſe Miracles that are wrought, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be wrought, for the proof of ſuch Doctrines as are really contrary to that Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of our Lord, as it is delivered in the Holy Scriptures.</p>
               <p>We are ſure that <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles, taught no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the Truth of God, he having ſo
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:63712:123"/>publickly and ſo convincingly ſet his Seal to all their Doctrines. And we are ſure likewiſe that the Scripture contains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in it but what was taught by them, and conſequently muſt be the Truth of God alſo. And therefore, if any Doctrine or Article of Religion be at any time re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to our Belief, that doth not agree with theſe Holy Writings, or doth contradict them either directly or by plain unavoidable conſequence; we may be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually ſure that that Doctrine cannot be true, nor is to be received by us, though we are told of never ſo many private Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles that have been wrought for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of it.</p>
               <p>Our Rule in theſe Caſes is, <hi>To the Law and to the Teſtimony;</hi> To the Publick and undoubted Oracles of God, in the Old and New Teſtament. Whatever Doctrine can be proved out of them, we are bound to embrace it without a new Miracle. On the other ſide, Whatever Doctrine is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with them, we muſt reject it, though an <hi>Angel from Heaven,</hi> or <hi>one from the Dead</hi> ſhould come and Preach it to us.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> From hence we ſee the Vanity and Unreaſonableneſs of thoſ Men, that not content with the Ordinary Means of Grace, are always wiſhing for Extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries. There are a great many of us that will be ſaved by Methods of our own chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing,
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:63712:123"/>otherwiſe we will not be ſaved at all. As it was in St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s time, the <hi>Jews</hi> they required a <hi>Sign;</hi> the <hi>Greeks,</hi> they were for <hi>Wiſdom</hi> and Philoſophy; and perhaps a third ſort of Men were for another kind of means of Conviction: So it is among us.</p>
               <p>Here is one Man would have a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Miracle wrought for his Converſion. If he could ſee a Spirit or a Ghoſt, he would believe there was another World. If God would ſend an Angel from Heaven to preach to him, he thinks he ſhould be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a New Man.</p>
               <p>Here is another would believe the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, if every Point of it could be demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated by Reaſon, and a clear and plain account be given of all the Myſteries of it: but till that be done, he is of the Religion of the Philoſophers.</p>
               <p>Here is another Man waits for Immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate Impulſes and Inſpirations. The ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Aſſiſtances of the Spirit that acccom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany the Word and Sacraments will not do his buſineſs.</p>
               <p>But let us not deceive our ſelves. All theſe Imaginations are vain and fooliſh. If God ſhould grant us our ſeveral deſires; and give one of us a <hi>Sign,</hi> another of us a <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration,</hi> another of us a <hi>powerful Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction</hi> upon our Minds, from his Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and that in an extraordinary way: Yet it is ſtill very doubtful, whether, for
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:63712:124"/>all this, the Buſineſs of our Converſion would be effected.</p>
               <p>None was more confident than the Rich Man in the Parable, that if to the Teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets, was ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peradded a new Miracle, his Brethren would certainly be perſuaded: But yet you ſee, our Saviour affirms the direct con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary.</p>
               <p>Oh let us all cloſe with the ſtanding Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Methods which God hath eſtabliſhed in the Church, for the bringing us to Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and eternal Happineſs, and not be han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kering after new and fanciful ways of our own chuſing, Moſt certainly, the Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Means of Grace are ſufficient for the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all our Souls, and will be ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to that End, if we be not wanting to our ſelves. And if any Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries be at any time needful, God without doubt will ſupply us with them alſo.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and laſtly, From what hath been ſaid, we ſee the horrible Guilt and the utter Inexcuſableneſs of thoſe Men, that notwithſtanding the Goſpel means of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, that have been ſo long afforded them, do ſtill continue Infidels in their Judgment, or Immoral in their Lives.</p>
               <p>What will theſe Men be able to ſay for themſelves, when they come to appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judge of the World, at the great Day of Accounts? Will they pretend there
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:63712:124"/>was not force enough in the Goſpel-evidence to convince them, or weight enough in its Motives to reclaim them? Ah their own Hearts will give them the Lye. They can no longer be able to deceive themſelves. There will be no Unbelievers, no ſeared Conſciences, in the other State. They will then be clearly convinced, that God for his part did all that was neceſſary, nay all that was fit to be done, in order to their Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation: but they were reſolved to ſhut their Eyes, and harden their Hearts againſt the gracious Means that were tendred them.</p>
               <p>Oh, how will the Rich Man and his five Brethren in Hell riſe up in Judgment againſt theſe Men? For they only refuſed to hear <hi>Moſes</hi> and the Prophets: But theſe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides them, have obſtinately refuſed to hear <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Apoſtles, who brought abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly greater Light into the World than the former did.</p>
               <p>Much more, How will the poor igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant <hi>Heathens</hi> riſe up in Judgment againſt them? Who were deſtitute both of <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Chriſt;</hi> and yet, to the ſhame of <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> it may be ſpoken, have ſeveral of them lived better Lives than many of us do.</p>
               <p>May not we juſtly and ſadly apply that Woe which our Saviour pronounced of <hi>Chorazin</hi> and <hi>Bethſaida,</hi> to Thouſands among us? Woe unto you Unbelievers; Woe unto you, O obſtinate and irreclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:63712:125"/>Sinners; for if the mighty Means of Grace, the mighty Evidence of Truth, had been afforded to <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Sidon,</hi> to <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrha,</hi> to <hi>Mahometans</hi> and <hi>Pagans,</hi> that have been afforded unto you, <hi>they would long ago have repented in Sackcloth and Aſhes. But I ſay unto you, it ſhall be more tolerable for all theſe in the day of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than for you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>God Almighty give us all Grace ſeriouſly to conſider theſe things, that we may by a timely and hearty cloſing with his Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods and Deſigns for our Salvation, prevent the diſmal Conſequences of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity and a Vicious Life; that ſo it may not be our Condemnation at the laſt day,</hi> That Light is come into the World, and we have loved Darkneſs rather than Light.</p>

               <p>ANY one that uſeth to make re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexions upon his own Actions, cannot but obſerve, That one of the great occaſions of the ſins he is guilty of in the courſe of his Life, is the too free uſe of his lawful <hi>Liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not ſay, that any Man doth com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſin by uſing his <hi>lawful Liberty</hi> (for that would be a kind of contradiction): But I ſay, the uſing our <hi>Liberty</hi> to the utmoſt pitch and extent of that which we call <hi>law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful,</hi> is the occaſion of a great many ſins
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:63712:126"/>that would otherwiſe not have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.</p>
               <p>If one ſhould offer to tempt a Man that hath any Senſe of Vertue or Religion, to do a thing, that at the firſt ſight appears ſinful or wicked; it would certainly be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. Every one that has any regard to God or Goodneſs, would ſtart at ſuch a Propoſal. But here is our infelicity. A Temptation comes on by degrees. And at the firſt we are ingaged in nothing but what is lawful and honeſt; and accordingly we uſe that <hi>Liberty</hi> which <hi>Nature</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> allows us; and ſo we proceed on inſenſibly in the uſe of that <hi>Liberty,</hi> till at laſt we become uncertain whether we have not exceeded the bounds of what is <hi>lawful:</hi> And by this means we are often caught. Nay, indeed nothing but this could be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tray well-meaning Perſons, and ſuch as are vertuouſly diſpoſed, into ſin. <hi>Licitis perimus oumes,</hi> ſaid a devout Man: It is by <hi>lawful things</hi> that we commonly miſcarry.</p>
               <p>With great reaſon therefore doth St. <hi>Paul</hi> give this advice in the Text: <hi>Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>ye have been called unto Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, only uſe not Liberty for an occaſion to to the Fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no doubt but the Apoſtle writ theſe words upon occaſion of, and with reference to, the great Controverſy that was then on foot among Chriſtians, touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:63712:126"/>the Obligation of the Jewiſh Law.</p>
               <p>Some then thought themſelves bound in Conſcience to obſerve all the Precepts of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law. Other Chriſtians thought they were freed by the coming of Chriſt from all <hi>legal</hi> Obſervances. The Apoſtle determines the Caſe in Favour of theſe latter, and declares, that by the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel <hi>they were called unto Liberty,</hi> and were free from all the Moſaical Impoſitions. But yet nevertheleſs he tells them they ought to be careful in the exerciſe of that <hi>Liberty,</hi> that they <hi>do not uſe it for an occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That is to ſay, that this <hi>Liberty</hi> to which they were <hi>called,</hi> ſhould not Miniſter to any ſin. That they ſhould not ſo uſe it, as to be a ſnare, either to <hi>themſelves</hi> or <hi>others.</hi> To themſelves by running into licentiouſneſs, and taking <hi>unlawful Liberties.</hi> To <hi>others,</hi> either by affrighting the unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jews from the embracing Chriſtianity, or diſcouraging thoſe that already believed the Goſpel, in the profeſſion of it.</p>
               <p>This is the ſtrict Senſe of the Apoſtle's words, as they come in here in the Text, and as they do relate to that occaſion upon which he writ them. But that ſenſe, with reference to that occaſion, is now out of doors among us. Though the general Advice that is here given, will e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternally be good and uſeful; Nay, and
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:63712:127"/>always needful to be inſiſted on in all Ages of the World.</p>
               <p>We have none now <hi>that uſe their Liberty for an occaſion to the Fleſh,</hi> as to the point of the <hi>Judaical Ceremonies.</hi> But we have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance that do uſe it ſo as to other Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Nay, as I ſaid before, this too free uſe of our <hi>Liberty</hi> in <hi>lawful things,</hi> is one of the great Sources and Fountains from whence moſt of our irregularities do proceed. And therefore I do not know how I can entertain you more uſefully upon this Text, than by endeavouring to give you the beſt Rules I can, for the reducing the Apoſtle's Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation into practice, as it doth concern us at this day.</p>
               <p>But that you may ſee plainly what I drive at, I will yet ſtate the Matter a little more particularly.</p>
               <p>Our Caſe in this World is this. The Laws of <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Religion,</hi> do allow Men all <hi>reaſonable Liberties</hi> in the gratification of their natural Paſſions and Appetites, and in the uſe and enjoyment of all the good things of this Life. But all <hi>unreaſonable</hi> gratifications, all <hi>exceſſes</hi> and <hi>immoderate Liberties</hi> are forbidden by <hi>Religion,</hi> and therefore are <hi>ſinful</hi> and <hi>criminal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If now in all Caſes a Man could readily and certainly fix the preciſe <hi>bounds</hi> and <hi>land-marks</hi> of what is <hi>reaſonable</hi> and <hi>mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate,</hi> and what is <hi>unreaſonable</hi> and <hi>exceſſive</hi>
                  <pb n="247" facs="tcp:63712:127"/>in the uſe of his <hi>Liberty;</hi> ſo as that upon all occaſions, and in all emergencies, he could ſay within his own Mind, <hi>Thus far I may lawfully and innocently go in the gratification of ſuch an appetite, or in the enjoyment of ſuch a pleaſure,</hi> or the like; <hi>but if I proceed a ſtep farther, I become a Tranſgreſſor:</hi> I ſay, if this was the caſe of a Man in the <hi>uſe</hi> of his <hi>Liberty,</hi> it would be no hard matter for any well-diſpoſed Perſon to take all that <hi>Liberty</hi> that was <hi>moderate</hi> and <hi>lawful,</hi> and to forbear all that which is <hi>exceſſive</hi> and <hi>unlawful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But now this is not always an eaſy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be done. For many Caſes happen in which a Man cannot preciſely deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine where it is that his <hi>lawful Liberty</hi> ends, and where it is that it begins to be <hi>extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant</hi> and <hi>exceſſive.</hi> So that while a Man is only deſigning to gratifie his deſires in lawful inſtances, he is often carried be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his bounds, and proceeds to <hi>exceſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This now, I ſay, is one great occaſion of ſin to Mankind; and yet there is no avoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of it, becauſe it is ſuch a one as doth neceſſarily ariſe from the nature of things.</p>
               <p>Thus for inſtance: It is certainly very lawful for a Man to drink Wine and ſtrong Drink, not only for his Health's ſake, when his Conſtitution doth require it; but alſo for Chearfulneſs, and the Enjoyment of his Friends. But on the other ſide, <hi>Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Intemperance,</hi> are grievous Crimes,
<pb n="248" facs="tcp:63712:128"/>and utterly forbid by our Religion. Whilſt now a Man on one hand hath a deſire to take that Liberty that is allowed him, and to gratifie his natural inclination to <hi>mirth</hi> and <hi>pleaſantneſs,</hi> or to ſhew <hi>Civility,</hi> as he terms it, to his Company: And on the other hand, he has no certain unalterable meaſures to proceed by, for the ſtinting himſelf in this Caſe; (as ſurely it is a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry hard matter to preſcribe or define, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a Man's ſelf or others, the exact pitch or limits where <hi>Temperance</hi> ends, and <hi>Intemperance</hi> begins:) by this means, I ſay, he is often betrayed into ſin. Thinking with himſelf, that there is a great <hi>latitude</hi> and <hi>compaſs</hi> in the exerciſe of <hi>Temperance</hi> and <hi>Sobriety</hi> (as indeed there is,) and that therefore he may go on ſome time longer with the Company; the Wine by this means ſteals upon him, and he is, before he was aware, fallen into the ſin of <hi>Intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance</hi> and <hi>Exceſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And thus it is, not only as to the <hi>uſe</hi> of our Liberty in things allowed, but as to the performance of our <hi>Duty</hi> in things <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Every Man is ſenſible, that it is a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Law of our Religion to be <hi>Charitable,</hi> and to give Alms out of our Subſtance. But now it is not ſo eaſy a matter for any Man to define, and ſet cut the <hi>quantum,</hi> or the preciſe proportion of Alms, which every
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:63712:128"/>one is bound to give; ſo as to be able to pronounce, that if a Man give ſo much, he performs his Duty, and is a <hi>Charitable</hi> Man, for one in his Circumſtances; but if he gives leſs than that, he is <hi>Covetous</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitable.</hi> Now, I ſay, becauſe this Duty of <hi>Charity</hi> is thus indefinitely left, and there is ſuch an <hi>affinity</hi> and <hi>undiſtinguiſhableneſs</hi> between the leaſt meaſures of <hi>Charity,</hi> and the ſin of being <hi>uncharitable;</hi> Men do from hence often take occaſion to fall ſhort in the performance of it. And as in the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer inſtance I gave about <hi>drinking,</hi> they are apt to take more <hi>Liberty</hi> than is <hi>allowed</hi> them; ſo in this they are apt to do leſs than is <hi>commanded</hi> them. For if they do but give ſomething to the poor out of their yearly Income, they think they give enough to ſatisfie the Command of <hi>Charity;</hi> and ſo they make no Conſcience of <hi>ſaving</hi> and <hi>hoarding</hi> without end or without meaſure.</p>
               <p>There are a hundred more inſtances be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides theſe two that I have named, wherein there is ſuch a <hi>latitude</hi> left to our practices, and the difference between <hi>lawful</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful, Duty</hi> and <hi>Sin,</hi> lies in ſo ſmall a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, that it is hard to ſeparate and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh them, unleſs a Man be both very wiſe and very honeſt.</p>
               <p>We have not any Law of God which defines how often we are to <hi>pray;</hi> Or when it is our Duty to <hi>faſt;</hi> Or to what degree
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:63712:129"/>we may be <hi>angry;</hi> Or how we are to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern our ſelves as to the quantity or kinds of our <hi>meat</hi> and <hi>drink;</hi> Or how far we may comply with the <hi>Cuſtoms</hi> of the World; Or how ſplendid we may be in our <hi>Apparel</hi> and <hi>Equipage;</hi> Or what <hi>Games</hi> and <hi>Recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> may be uſed, and how often; Or what Rules we are to go by in <hi>buying</hi> and <hi>ſelling,</hi> and our other dealings with Men; Or how far we may ſeek our own, when our right cannot be obtained without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to our Neighbour.</p>
               <p>In theſe, I ſay, and abundance of other Caſes, we have no expreſs particular Laws of God to ſteer and meaſure our Actions by; nor indeed is it poſſible we ſhould have: Becauſe what is fit and reaſonable to be done in theſe Caſes, admits of ſo great a difference from the infinite variety of the circumſtances of particular Men.</p>
               <p>What now muſt we do in theſe Caſes? How muſt we order our ſelves, that we may perform our Duty, and keep out of ſin?</p>
               <p>Why in anſwer to this I ſay, We have only general Rules to direct us in theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and thoſe Rules we are to apply to our own particular caſes.</p>
               <p>In this <hi>latitude</hi> that things are left in, we are to uſe our <hi>Liberty</hi> as carefully and as prudently as is poſſible; taking our mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures from the Principles of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> and the
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:63712:129"/>general Rules of the <hi>Goſpel.</hi> Now what thoſe general Rules and meaſures are, it is my buſineſs at this time to treat of.</p>
               <p>And <hi>three</hi> things I have here to propoſe for the <hi>uſe</hi> of our <hi>Liberty,</hi> which will, I think, be a ſufficient Direction to us in all caſes of this nature; and which if we do carefully obſerve, we ſhall never <hi>uſe our Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty for an occaſion to the Fleſh;</hi> but we ſhall both come up to what is our Duty, and ſhall likewiſe avoid all thoſe ſins which Mankind are ſo frequently betrayed into, through the too great affinity that there is between <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Vice,</hi> and the indiſcreet exerciſe of their <hi>Liberty</hi> upon occaſion thereof.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>firſt</hi> thing I would poſſeſs you all with, and which indeed, as it is the moſt ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, ſo it is the beſt advice that can be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in this matter, is this: <hi>That we would endeavour to be heartily honeſt and ſerious in the buſineſs of Religion:</hi> That we would ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely devote our ſelves to the ſervice of God: That we would purifie our Minds as much as may be from all ſenſual and ſelfiſh Principles; and in all our Actions and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuits have more reſpect to the doing our Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the approving our ſelves to our great Lord and Maſter, than to any other conſideration.</p>
               <p>This is that which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſo often ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horts us to. <hi>Whether</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>you eat or drink, or whatever ye do, do all to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:63712:130"/>of God.</hi> And again, <hi>Whatever ye do, do it heartily, as unto the Lord, knowing that of the Lord you ſhall receive the reward of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we could once get our ſelves poſſeſſed of this <hi>Probity,</hi> this <hi>Purity</hi> of Mind and Heart, it would better inſtruct us in the <hi>uſe</hi> of our <hi>Liberty,</hi> and teach us to diſtinguiſh between <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil;</hi> what is ſit to be done, and what ought not to be done, in all caſes and emergencies we are concerned in; than all the dry Rules of <hi>Caſuiſtical</hi> Learning, be they never ſo carefully and accurately laid down.</p>
               <p>When a Man is once arrived to that ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly temper of Mind, that he heartily loves God and his Neighbour, and has ſuch a lively ſenſe of the truth and the excellency of Chriſt's Religion; that he is reſolved, that that ſhall influence and govern the whole courſe of his Life, and that he will do all his Actions, as much as he can, for the honour of our Lord, and the advancement of his ſervice in the World: There can hardly any particular caſe occur to ſuch a Man in which he will not have rules and meaſures ready at hand to ſteer and direct him in his proceedings.</p>
               <p>Nay this general Principle alone <hi>of doing all his actions to the glory of God,</hi> that is to ſay, to the honour of his Religion, and the edification of his Neighbour: I ſay this
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:63712:130"/>alone will afford him ſufficient light and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection for the government of his Actions in all Contingencies. Becauſe there is no Action he can be ingaged in, but it is at the firſt ſight diſcernable, whether the doing of it, or the not doing of it, doth more tend to the honour of his Religion, or the good of others.</p>
               <p>That which makes the conduct of a Man's ſelf in this World, ſo nice and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult a matter, and has given occaſion to the diſcuſſion of ſo many Caſes of Concience about the <hi>lawfulneſs</hi> or <hi>unlawfulneſs</hi> of Actions, is this; That Men are not throughly <hi>honeſt,</hi> but halt between God and the World. They have a great mind to <hi>ſerve</hi> their <hi>pleaſure</hi> and their <hi>ambition,</hi> and their ſecular ends, and yet to <hi>ſerve God</hi> too; and this puts them upon <hi>tampering</hi> and trying to reconcile theſe intereſts to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether.</p>
               <p>Whence it comes to paſs, that the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual Queſtions that ariſe about their Actions, are not, what is beſt to be done, or what is moſt agreeable to their Duty in this or the other eaſe? But, how far they may go in the gratification of ſuch an Appetite or Paſſion, without trangreſſing the Laws of God? How far they may ſatisfie their <hi>cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous</hi> deſires, without being <hi>unjuſt?</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they may uſe ſuch <hi>arts</hi> or <hi>tricks,</hi> in getting or ſaving, without being <hi>knaviſh;</hi>
                  <pb n="254" facs="tcp:63712:131"/>How far they may <hi>drink,</hi> and not be <hi>drunk?</hi> How far they may gratifie their humour of <hi>decking</hi> and <hi>adorning</hi> themſelves, and yet do no unlawful thing? How far they may indulge <hi>wantonneſs,</hi> and yet be <hi>chaſt?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now as I ſaid before, ſuch Queſtions as theſe are not eaſy to be reſolved (nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the Goſpel of Chriſt ſo contrived, as if it had taken much care whether they were reſolved or no.) But they are really Caſes and Problems that require both Judgment and Learning, and likewiſe the conſideration of abundance of particular circumſtances, to have a good account gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of them.</p>
               <p>But now the Man that doth intirely give up himſelf to the conduct of the Spirit, and propoſeth nothing to himſelf in all his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions but the pure glory of God: Such a Man having none of theſe Worldly ſenſual deſigns to ſerve in his Actions, can rarely be ſuppoſed to have any of theſe Queſtions to put to himſelf. And conſequently he can never be at a loſs or uncertainty, how he is to act for want of a reſolution of them, much leſs can he be in danger of tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing the bounds that God hath fixed to his Actions.</p>
               <p>All the point that ſuch a one hath to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider in any Action is, whether will his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or not doing ſuch an Action better ſerve the ends of Religion? Which will tend
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:63712:131"/>moſt to his own ſpiritual benefit, and the profit of his Neighbour, to purſue this deſign, or to let it alone? Whether will be more conducive to the Honour of his Lord, to gratifie ſuch an Appetite, or to deny it ſatisfaction?</p>
               <p>This, I ſay, is the only Queſtion that ſuch a Man has to put to himſelf, and there is no difficulty in giving an Anſwer to it. For there is ſcarce any caſe to be put concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Action, but it is very obvious, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Inſtructer, to find out which ſide of the caſe, if it be choſen, will moſt mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to the ends of <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi> Or if it be not obvious, then it is very certain, the Man needs not much deliberate about it, but may chuſe either ſide indifferently.</p>
               <p>It is a very hard matter oftentimes to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine concerning the <hi>Neceſſity</hi> and <hi>Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation</hi> of Actions; that is, whether a Man be <hi>bound</hi> to do them or no. It is likewiſe often a hard matter to determine concerning the <hi>lawfulneſs</hi> of Actions, whether a Man <hi>may</hi> do them or no. But it is a very eaſy mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in moſt caſes to determine concerning the <hi>expedience</hi> of Actions; that is to ſay, whether it be <hi>beſt</hi> and <hi>fitteſt</hi> for a Man to do them or no. Now this laſt, I ſay, is the point that a throughly good Man will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider and ſteer himſelf by in all his Actions.</p>
               <pb n="256" facs="tcp:63712:132"/>
               <p>Thus for Inſtance, It may perhaps bear a diſpute, Whether a Man be preciſely bound by God's Law, to <hi>pray</hi> ſolemnly twice a day, ſo as that he ſins if he do not: But it will bear no diſpute, that it is much better and more acceptable to God, and beneficial to our ſelves, to pray at leaſt thus often, than to pray ſeldomer. And therefore ſuch a Perſon as I am ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, will upon this conſideration put it in practice (nay and <hi>pray</hi> oftner too as he has occaſion) without concerning himſelf whether he be ſtrictly bound ſo to do or no.</p>
               <p>It may bear a diſpute among ſome Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whether <hi>painting</hi> the <hi>Face</hi> be not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowable to Chriſtian Women. But it can bear no diſpute among any, that it is more agreeable to the Sobriety, and Modeſty, and Chaſtity of a Diſciple of Jeſus Chriſt, and better ſerves the ends of Religion, to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear all ſuch ſuſpicious Ornaments. (There being rarely any good end to be ſerved by them, but abundance of evil often ariſing from them.) Now this conſideration a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone is enough to ſet the Heart of every ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Chriſtian againſt thoſe practices, and to make them wholly to refrain them.</p>
               <p>Thus again, it is argued both ways a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout <hi>Play</hi> or <hi>Gaming,</hi> whether it be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful or no: (eſpecially when ſums of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney are played for; and the thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes rather an <hi>avaritious</hi> Contention,
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:63712:132"/>than a <hi>Recreation</hi> and <hi>Divertiſement</hi>) ſome believing that it is innocent; others that it is a grievous ſin. But there is no Man, even of thoſe that uſe it moſt, but will readily acknowledge, that it expoſeth a Man to great and Dangerous <hi>Temptations</hi> of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry kinds; that it is the occaſion of abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of <hi>Sin,</hi> and abundance of <hi>Miſchief,</hi> and that it ſeldom fails to produce intolerable conſequences, both as to Men's <hi>Souls,</hi> and <hi>Eſtates,</hi> and <hi>Families.</hi> Now to a Man that loves God, and hath a tender ſenſe of his Duty, this is enough in all Conſcience to deter him for ever from the practice of <hi>Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming,</hi> though it be not made to appear to him, that it is <hi>expreſly</hi> and <hi>explicitly</hi> forbid by any Law of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that you ſee, that in thoſe points where there are diſputes on both ſides, when the Conſideration is concerning the <hi>Obligation,</hi> or the <hi>lawfulneſs</hi> of an Action; there is no difficulty, no diſpute at all, when the Conſideration is only concerning what is <hi>beſt</hi> and moſt <hi>fitting</hi> to be done; concerning what is moſt agreeable to our Duty, and moſt conducive to the Honour of God and Religion as to that Action. That is evident enough in all Caſes; nor is any Man at a loſs for finding it out. And that is the Principle which I ſay every ſincere lover of God governs himſelf by; and which I would have us all to propoſe
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:63712:133"/>to our ſelves for the Rule of our Actions, in order to the ſecuring us from thoſe <hi>ſnares</hi> and <hi>ſtumbling blocks,</hi> to which the <hi>affinity</hi> between <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Vice, Lawful</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful,</hi> will otherwiſe expoſe us.</p>
               <p>Let us not ſtand upon points with God Almighty, as if ſo much was his, and ſo much was our own; as if we were to ſhare our ſelves between his Service and our own Pleaſures and Profits, and the like; and were reſolved not to pay him any more reſpect or love, than what ſome expreſs Letter of his Law doth exact at our Hands. But let us ſo entirely devote our ſelves to his Service, as to do not only all thoſe things which we are ſtrictly bound to do, or elſe we are Tranſgreſſors; but all thoſe things that are acceptable to him, all thoſe things that are praiſe worthy, and tend to the Perfection of our Nature, and the Reputation of Chriſt's Religion.</p>
               <p>Let us make it the end of our Actions, not to ſeek our ſelves but his Glory; eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry day to grow better and better, and in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Occurrence to conſider, not what may <hi>lawfully</hi> be done, but what is Moſt <hi>becoming</hi> a <hi>Diſciple</hi> of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> to do. In a word, what ever is <hi>beſt</hi> in any Action; what ever moſt ſerves the end of <hi>piety;</hi> what ever tends moſt to the credit of our Religion, and the benefit of others, let us conſider that, and act accordingly.</p>
               <pb n="259" facs="tcp:63712:133"/>
               <p>And thus I am ſure to deſign and act, is moſt ſuitable to the Nature and Genius of our Chriſtian Religion; nay, indeed, it is the Principal Law and Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it.</p>
               <p>The deſign of Chriſtianity is not to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt the preciſe bounds of <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Vice, Lawful</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nlawful,</hi> which is that that a great many among us ſo greedily hanker after. For the beſt that could have come from ſuch a deſign, had been only this, that Men by this means might have been fairly inſtructed, how they might have avoided the being <hi>bad;</hi> though they never became very <hi>good.</hi> But the deſign of Chriſtianity; is to make Men as <hi>good</hi> as they can poſſibly be; as <hi>devout,</hi> as <hi>humble,</hi> as <hi>charitable,</hi> as <hi>temperate,</hi> as <hi>contented,</hi> as <hi>heavenly-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> as their Natures will allow of in this World. And for the producing this effect, the exact diſtinguiſhing the <hi>limits</hi> of the ſeveral <hi>Vertues,</hi> and their oppoſite <hi>Vices,</hi> ſignifies very little.</p>
               <p>The Laws of our great Maſter are not like the <hi>Civil Municipal</hi> Laws of Kingdoms, which are therefore wonderfully nice and critical, and particular in ſetting bounds to the practices of Men, becauſe they only look at <hi>overt Actions;</hi> ſo that if a Man do but keep his <hi>Actions</hi> within the compaſs of the <hi>Letter</hi> of the Law, he may be accounted a good Subject, and is no way obnoxious
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:63712:134"/>to the <hi>Penalties</hi> which the Law threatens.</p>
               <p>If our Religion had been of this ſtrain, we ſhould without doubt have had a World of particular Laws and Precepts, and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections about our Actions, in all emergent Caſes more than we now have: And we might as eaſily have known from the <hi>Bible</hi> what was <hi>forbidden unlawful Anger,</hi> what was <hi>exceſſive drinking,</hi> what was <hi>pride</hi> and <hi>luxury</hi> in <hi>Apparel,</hi> and the like; as we now know by the <hi>Statute-Book,</hi> what is <hi>Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glary</hi> or <hi>Murther,</hi> or <hi>Treaſon.</hi> But there was no need of theſe particularities in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of Chriſt Jeſus. His Religion was to be a Spiritual thing. And the deſign of it was not to make us <hi>chaſt,</hi> or <hi>temperate,</hi> or <hi>humble,</hi> or <hi>charitable,</hi> in ſuch a degree; but to make us as <hi>chaſt</hi> and <hi>temperate,</hi> as <hi>humble</hi> and <hi>charitable,</hi> as <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>holy</hi> in all our Converſation, as we poſſibly can be.</p>
               <p>This I ſay was the deſign of Chriſt's Religion. It was to be the Higheſt <hi>Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy</hi> that was ever taught to Mankind. It was to make us the moſt excellent and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect Creatures, as to <hi>purity</hi> of <hi>Mind</hi> and <hi>Heart,</hi> that Humane Nature is capable of. And therefore it hath not been ſo accurate and particular in preſcribing bounds to our <hi>outward Actions,</hi> becauſe it was abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly enough for the ſecuring them, to oblige us to the higheſt degree of <hi>inward purity</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="261" facs="tcp:63712:134"/>
               <p>And this it hath done above all the Laws and Religions in the World. It teacheth us to abhor every thing that is evil or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pure in all the <hi>kinds</hi> of it, in all the <hi>degrees</hi> of it, and in all the <hi>tendencies</hi> towards it; And to lay out our ſelves in the purſuit of every thing that is <hi>honeſt,</hi> that is <hi>lovely,</hi> that is <hi>praiſe-worthy,</hi> and of <hi>good report</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men.</p>
               <p>If this now be the deſign of our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and theſe be the Laws of it, I leave it to <hi>you</hi> to judge of theſe two things. <hi>Firſt,</hi> Whether it doth not highly concern all of us that profeſs this holy Religion, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, in all our Converſation, to be as holy and as vertuous as we can, and to do as much good as we can; and not to content our ſelves with ſuch a degree of <hi>honeſty</hi> and <hi>vertue,</hi> as is juſt ſufficient to the rende<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring us <hi>not vicious.</hi> And then <hi>ſecondly,</hi> Whether, if we do thus endeavour, we can eaſily be at a loſs in diſtinguiſhing between <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil, Duty</hi> and <hi>Sin,</hi> in any inſtance; And conſequently, Whether we can be much in danger of ill <hi>uſing</hi> our <hi>Liberty,</hi> and ſo tranſgreſſing upon that account.</p>
               <p>I have been longer upon this firſt Head than I intended, but I ſhall make amends for it by diſpatching the two following, in ſo much the fewer words. And indeed af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſo large an account as I have given of the general Rule, there is leſs need of dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling upon particular ones.</p>

               <p n="2">II. In the <hi>ſecond</hi> place, In order to the <hi>right uſe of our Liberty,</hi> and ſo ſecuring our ſerves from falling into ſin, through miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the meaſures of <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil;</hi> This will be a good Rule to propoſe to our ſelves, namely, <hi>That in matters of</hi> Duty, <hi>we ſhould rather do too much than too little: But in matters of</hi> Indifferency, <hi>we ſhould rather take too little of our Liberty than too much.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> As to matters of <hi>Duty</hi> my mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is this: That where the Laws of God have generally and indefinitely commanded a thing, but have not ſet down Rules about the particular meaſures and proportions of it; in that caſe it is adviſable rather to do more than we are perhaps preciſely bound to do, that ſo we may be ſure we have perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med our Duty; than by being ſcanty in our obedience, to run the hazard of falling ſhort of our Duty.</p>
               <p>Thus for inſtance, Our Lord in the New Teſtament, hath often and ſolemnly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded us to <hi>pray.</hi> But neither he nor his Apoſtles, have any where told us how <hi>often</hi> we are to pray; only they have bid us pray frequently. In this Caſe now a Man that makes a Conſcience of performing his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, will take all occaſions and opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of liſting up holy hands, and devout af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to his heavenly Father: However, he will not fail, at leaſt <hi>once</hi> every time he riſeth, and <hi>once</hi> every time he goes to reſt,
<pb n="263" facs="tcp:63712:135"/>to offer up a <hi>ſolemn</hi> Sacrifice of <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Praiſe.</hi> Leſs than this, I ſay, he muſt not do, for fear he break the Commandment of praying <hi>frequently,</hi> praying <hi>continually.</hi> But more than this it will become him to do, in order to the giving himſelf ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that he hath fully performed it.</p>
               <p>Thus again, <hi>To give Alms to the poor,</hi> is an indiſpenſable Duty of our Religion. But what proportion of our ſubſtance we are to give away in <hi>Alms</hi> and Charity, is no where ſet down; but is wholly left to our <hi>diſcretion.</hi> Now in this caſe, it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly much more adviſable to give <hi>liberal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> and <hi>largely,</hi> and <hi>plentifully;</hi> even as much as our condition in this World, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſities of our Families can allow: though by ſo doing, we ſhall prove to have given in greater abundance than we were ſtrictly obliged to: Than by giving <hi>ſtingily</hi> and <hi>pinchingly,</hi> now and then a little <hi>pocket mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney</hi> or ſo, to run the hazard of being Trangreſſors of the Commandment, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving our Portion among the <hi>covetous</hi> and <hi>unmerciful.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no <hi>damage</hi> comes to a Man by doing the former; but on the contrary, a great deal of <hi>good.</hi> For God never fails <hi>bounteouſly</hi> to reward the <hi>bountiful</hi> hand. But there is both <hi>damage</hi> and infinite <hi>danger</hi> in the latter. And thus we are to practiſe in all other Duties.</p>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:63712:136"/>
               <p>Only this caution we muſt take along with us: That we are always ſo to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion the meaſures of every ſingle Duty, as to render it conſiſtent with the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of the other Duties of our lives.</p>
               <p>As for inſtance, we muſt not ſpend ſo much time in <hi>Prayer,</hi> as to hinder the purſuit of our <hi>Callings,</hi> and neceſſary buſineſs. We muſt ſo <hi>give Alms,</hi> as yet to leave our ſelves enough to pay every one their own, and to make a competent proviſion for our Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. But let us but take care to ſecure this, and then we cannot eaſily exceed in the meaſures of any Duty. The more we <hi>pray</hi> and the more we <hi>give alms,</hi> ſtill the bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. And ſo in all other inſtances of Duty.</p>
               <p>But now in the <hi>ſecond</hi> place, the quite contrary to this are we to practiſe in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of <hi>Liberty.</hi> There the rule is, rather to take <hi>leſs</hi> than is allowed us, than to take <hi>all.</hi> Rather to abridge our ſelves of our lawful <hi>Liberties,</hi> than by doing all that we may lawfully do, indanger our falling in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſin.</p>
               <p>There is no harm at all in departing from our Rights and Privileges which God hath indulged us: But there is a great harm in extending them beyond their bounds. There is no evil in not gratifying our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires and appetites in all the things they crave, which are allowable, and which we are permitted to gratifie them in: But
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:63712:136"/>there is an infinite evil in gratifying them in unlawful forbidden inſtances. And therefore every wiſe and good Man will be ſure to keep on the ſafe ſide; and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the danger of doing more than he ſhould do, he will not always do all that he may do.</p>
               <p>The truth is, that Man that makes no ſcruple of <hi>uſing</hi> his <hi>Liberty</hi> to the utmoſt ſtretch and extent of it upon all occaſions, and regards nothing more in his Actions, than juſt that he do not fall into ſome di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect ſin: That Man cannot always be inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, but will be drawn into a hundred ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regularities and miſcarriages.</p>
               <p>Thus for Example, he that uſeth him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to <hi>eat</hi> or to <hi>drink</hi> to the utmoſt pitch that can be ſaid to be within the limits of <hi>Temperance,</hi> it is impoſſible but ſuch a one will now and then be unavoidably overta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in the ſin of <hi>Gluttony</hi> or <hi>Drunkenneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He that will uſe all the <hi>liberties</hi> that the Law allows him, for the making <hi>advantages</hi> to himſelf in his <hi>Trade,</hi> or his Dealings with other Men: Such a one will not be able to avoid the juſt imputation of being in many inſtances an <hi>Oppreſſor</hi> or a hard <hi>Conſcienced</hi> Man.</p>
               <p>The ſafeſt way therefore, if we mean to preſerve our Vertue amidſt the multitude of Snares and Temptations that we meet with in the World, is to ſet bounds even to our
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:63712:137"/>
                  <hi>Lawful Liberties;</hi> to keep our actions within ſuch a compaſs, as not to come even near the <hi>Confines</hi> of <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Though it is but a <hi>point,</hi> and that often an undiſcernable one, that diſtinguiſheth between what is <hi>lawful,</hi> and what is <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful.</hi> Yet there is a great <hi>latitude</hi> in what is <hi>lawful.</hi> That is, if I gratify my Appetites but a little, I do that which is <hi>lawful;</hi> and if I gratifie them more, I may do that which is <hi>lawful</hi> likewiſe. But he ſhews the moſt Honeſt and Vertuous Mind, that in his actions takes but a little of this <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude,</hi> and by that means keeps himſelf at a good diſtance from that which is <hi>vicious</hi> and <hi>criminal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. But <hi>thirdly</hi> and laſtly, To what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree ſoever we may think fit to make uſe of our liberty; yet at all times, <hi>As ſoon as we begin to doubt or fear we have gone as far as we lawfully can go; it is then high time to break off, and to proceed no farther.</hi> This is the laſt Rule I have to offer upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. And thus alſo, wherever we have a juſt ground of <hi>ſuſpition</hi> or <hi>doubt,</hi> whether a thing be <hi>lawful</hi> or no; this <hi>doubt</hi> or <hi>ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion,</hi> is of it ſelf reaſon enough to make us forbear that thing. Unleſs indeed there be a <hi>Neceſſity,</hi> or a great <hi>Charity</hi> to be ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by the doing of it, which may in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon over-balance the <hi>ſuſpicion</hi> of its law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs.</p>
               <pb n="267" facs="tcp:63712:137"/>
               <p>Thus in matters of <hi>Recreation.</hi> If we have the leaſt doubt, whether this or the other <hi>Pleaſure</hi> or <hi>Divertiſement</hi> be <hi>innocent</hi> and <hi>lawful;</hi> why that is Argument enough without more ado, to make us <hi>forbear</hi> it; though perhaps we ſee others uſe it without ſcruple.</p>
               <p>Thus in matters of <hi>Temperance,</hi> when we firſt begin to ſuſpect that we have <hi>drunk</hi> as much as is convenient for us: Let us by all means leave off, and break from the Company.</p>
               <p>Thus in matters of <hi>Sobriety,</hi> when we have reaſon to doubt, that we are come up to the full bounds of the Chriſtian <hi>gravity</hi> and <hi>modeſty;</hi> and that any degree more of <hi>pomp</hi> or <hi>bravery</hi> in our <hi>garb,</hi> or in our <hi>atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance,</hi> or in our <hi>equipage,</hi> will reliſh of Pride, or Vanity, or Affectation: It is high time rather to abate ſomething of our <hi>ſumptuouſneſs</hi> in theſe things, than to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed any farther.</p>
               <p>And thus laſtly in matters of <hi>Equity</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> when we firſt begin to have a <hi>ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion,</hi> that ſuch a practice is an <hi>indirect</hi> or <hi>knaviſh</hi> trick, or that we are too <hi>ſevere</hi> and <hi>hard</hi> upon a Man, upon whom we have got an advantage: Why, this <hi>ſuſpition</hi> alone is enough in reaſon to check us in our ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riere, and to put us upon more fair and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate courſes.</p>
               <pb n="268" facs="tcp:63712:138"/>
               <p>This is a Rule that will for ever be fit for us to practice, for it is grounded upon Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Reaſon. Indeed it is as old as <hi>Morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Quod dubitas ne feceris.</hi> Do nothing that you doubt of, is a maxim that obtain'd among the Heathens as well as among us Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>I dare not indeed ſay, that this Rule holds univerſally in all Caſes. For Caſes do ſometimes happen, wherein it will be adviſable for a Man to act even againſt his doubts. But in ſuch Matters as I am now ſpeaking of, Matters wherein a Man is at perfect Liberty to act or not to act: In all ſuch Caſes, it will always, without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, be a true, and a ſafe, and a wiſe Rule. And I am ſure if Men would ſeriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly charge themſelves with the practice of it, they would hereby prevent a Multitude of Sins and Tranſgreſſions, with which they uſually <hi>inflame</hi> their <hi>Accounts</hi> againſt the day of Judgment.</p>
               <p>And thus much of the <hi>Rules</hi> I had to propoſe, as to the <hi>uſe of our Liberty,</hi> in ſuch Caſes where a Man is at a loſs in find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the Meaſures and bounds of <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Sin,</hi> and upon that account is in danger of Tranſgreſſing. I have only two things more to add upon this Argument, by way of <hi>Application,</hi> and I have done. The one as a <hi>Caution</hi> to prevent the miſapplying theſe Rules; the other as an <hi>encouragement</hi> to put them in practice.</p>
               <pb n="269" facs="tcp:63712:138"/>
               <p>That which I have to ſay by way of <hi>Caution</hi> is this: That what I have been now recommending, eſpecially under the two laſt Heads, is not intended to be a Rule or direction to any <hi>Hypochondriack,</hi> or Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy Perſons, or ſuch as are apt to be <hi>over-ſcrupulous</hi> about their Actions: For in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to ſuch Perſons it is the worſt advice that can be given.</p>
               <p>For they are apt to doubt and boggle at every thing, be it never ſo innocent and free from blame. They dare not eat a hearty Meal for fear of being <hi>Intemperate.</hi> And for fear of not being <hi>devout</hi> enough they exhauſt their Spirits, and ſpoil their Health, through the continual <hi>intention</hi> of their Minds to ſerious things.</p>
               <p>Now Perſons that are of this temper, are rather to be encouraged to take more <hi>Liberties</hi> than they do, than to abate any that they make uſe of.</p>
               <p>But their Caſe is of another Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and foreign to my preſent purpoſe; and therefore I here ſay no more about it. It being ſufficient to have given this intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to ſuch People, that they do not make an ill uſe of any thing that I have now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented; for aſſuredly, what hath been now ſaid, doth not much concern them.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The other thing I have to ſay, and that by way of <hi>Encouragement,</hi> is this: I doubt not but ſome will be apt to think,
<pb n="270" facs="tcp:63712:139"/>that the Rules I have now given about the <hi>Exerciſe of our Liberty,</hi> are much too ſtrict and ſevere; and that if they muſt be tied up to ſuch Meaſures, then farewel all the <hi>joy</hi> and <hi>pleaſure,</hi> and <hi>comfort</hi> of their lives. But to ſuch People I would crave leave to ſay, that they have very wrong notions of this Matter.</p>
               <p>The uſing of their <hi>Liberty</hi> in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as I have been recommending, would not rob them of one true <hi>pleaſure</hi> or <hi>comfort</hi> that this World affords. So far from that, that I am very ſure, whoever frames his Life according to theſe Meaſures, ſhall live a hundred times a happier Life, and ſhall enjoy the World and all the <hi>pleaſures</hi> and <hi>advantages</hi> of it, much more to his own content and ſatisfaction; than if he put no check to the craving of his Appetites, but always indulged and gratified them in every thing, and as much as they deſired.</p>
               <p>Aſſure your ſelves Vertue and Religion will never hinder you from enjoying any pleaſure or ſatisfaction that is natural. On the contrary there is great Reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, that the practice thereof will extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heighten and advance the ſatisfactions you can receive from your Worldly Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. I doubt not in the leaſt, but to a ſincerely pious and Vertuous Man, and that hath a Regard to God in all his Actions, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the very pleaſures and comforts of this
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:63712:139"/>Life are more gratifying and affecting, than to any ſenſual or wicked Man. For ſuch a one, as he is more capable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying them, ſo do they come to him like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe without the mixtures of thoſe uneaſy, troubleſome, bitter Reflexions, that other Men feel in the very beſt of their Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>Let no Man therefore apprehend any loſs of his pleaſures by entirely devoting him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to God's Service, and <hi>uſing his liberty</hi> in that careful way I have been recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Let him not think that he ſhall hereby be too much <hi>ſtraitned</hi> and confined. For certainly this is the true means, not only to keep him for ever from being a Slave to any thing, but alſo mightily to improve and encreaſe his <hi>Liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For by thus exerciſing himſelf, all the Powers of his Soul will be vaſtly enlarged, and he will hereby attain both <hi>leiſure</hi> and <hi>will</hi> to employ all his rational Faculties about the beſt and the nobleſt objects in the World, which will yield him the greateſt pleaſure that is to be had on this ſide Heaven. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if he had given up himſelf to be govern'd by any of his ſenſual Appetites, he had been a <hi>poor narrow confined</hi> Creature indeed, not capable of any greater ſatisfactions or pleaſures, than what the Brutes do enjoy as well as himſelf, but with leſs uneaſineſs, and fewer diſturbances.</p>
               <p>It is true indeed, a ſenſual Man hath no
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:63712:140"/>notion of this kind of pleaſures, no more than a <hi>Beaſt</hi> hath of the pleaſures of a <hi>Man.</hi> And therefore it is no wonder that ſuch Men entertain all talk about them as little better than meer <hi>Cant</hi> and <hi>Jargon.</hi> But I ſeriouſly appeal to all Men that have ever made any trials in the way of Religion and Vertue, whether the Contentments and Satisfactions they have received from the rational uſe of their <hi>Liberty,</hi> and the thoughts and reflexions that hereby they do approve themſelves to God, and live in hopes of his Favour, and have a fair proſpect of a glorious Immortal Sate in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other world: I ſay, Whether they do not find the pleaſures and contentments that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from hence, to be infinitely more ſolid, and ſubſtantial, and durable, than any of thoſe that they receive from the gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ſenſual Appetites in a vitious unreaſonable Manner.</p>
               <p>Oh therefore, Let none of us make any ſcruple of devoting our ſelves entirely and without reſerve to God Almighty's Service. Let none of us be afraid to put reaſonable reſtraints upon our Paſſions and Appetites. Aſſuredly the thus <hi>uſing our Liberty,</hi> is the certain way to preſerve and encreaſe it, and with it, the pleaſure and comfort of our Lives; and not only ſo, but to render us Everlaſtingly Happy and Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in the other World. Which that we may all be, <hi>God of his infinite Mercy grant,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <p>THeſe are the words of God to <hi>Moſes</hi> concerning the Children of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And two things may be gathered from them.</p>
               <p n="1">I. His ſerious deſire of their Happineſs.</p>
               <pb n="174" facs="tcp:63712:141"/>
               <p n="2">II. The means whereby that Happineſs is to be attained.</p>
               <p>The firſt of theſe is imported in that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn <hi>wiſh</hi> into which the Text is framed: <hi>O that there were ſuch an Heart in them,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that it might be well with them, and with their Children for ever.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The ſecond is imported in the way of connecting the former part of the wiſh with that which follows: <hi>O that there were ſuch an heart in them,</hi> what then? <hi>That they would fear me, and keep all my Commandments always,</hi> and why ſo? It follows, <hi>That it might be well with them, and with their Children for ever.</hi> Which plainly implies, That the way to have things well with them, and with their Children, is to fear God, and keep all his Commandments always.</p>
               <p>I have but one thing more to obſerve con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Text, and that is this: That the wiſh or deſire that God here expreſſes of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael</hi>'s <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Happineſs,</hi> doth not ſo much relate to the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> conſidered <hi>ſingly,</hi> and as <hi>particular</hi> Perſons, (though it cannot be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, but it doth extend to them, even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that notion) but it chiefly relates to the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> conſidered <hi>collectively,</hi> that is to ſay, under the notion of a <hi>People</hi> or <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi> God here expreſſes his care of the whole Nation, and ſeriouſly wiſhes they may be a happy People, they and their Children after them.</p>
               <pb n="175" facs="tcp:63712:141"/>
               <p>Two points then we have from this Text very proper to be inſiſted on, upon this Occaa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, which therefore I ſhall make the Heads of my following Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>That God is ſeriouſly concerned for the good and happineſs of Nations and Kingdoms, as well as that of particular Perſons; and more eſpecially of thoſe Nations that profeſs his true Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, <hi>That the Happineſs and Proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Nations is to be attained the ſame way that any particular Man's happineſs is,</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>by fearing God, and keeping his Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">I. I begin with the firſt, That <hi>God is ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly concerned for the good and happineſs of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Kingdoms, as well as that of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Perſons; and more eſpecially of thoſe Nations that Profeſs his true Religion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not think this is much doubted of by any Chriſtian, and therefore I need not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on a laborious proof of it.</p>
               <p>That God who doth not overlook the meaneſt and the moſt inconſiderable Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that he hath made; but ſo far concerns himſelf in taking care of them, and provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding for them, that not ſo much as <hi>a Sparrow</hi> (if we may believe our Saviour) <hi>doth fall to the ground without his will:</hi> Can it be imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that he is not more concerned for the happineſs and well-being of the nobleſt part of the viſible Creation, <hi>Mankind,</hi> who bear

               <p>And that God whoſe Care and Providence doth ſo particularly extend to every indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual Man, that (as the ſame our Lord Jeſus ſpeaks) <hi>the very Hairs of our Head are num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered by him.</hi> Can it be imagined, that he doth not ſtill take more care of the greater Bodies and Combinations of Men, ſuch as Nations and Kingdoms, which are ſo many ways more conſiderable than ſingle Men, and in whoſe Fortunes the good or ill of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons is ſo wholly bound up?

               <p>And laſtly, That God who is the Author, the Preſerver, the Protector of all publick Societies, <hi>by whom Kings Reign, and Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates decree Juſtice:</hi> Can it be imagined that he hath not ſtill a more particular regard to thoſe Nations that he hath been pleaſed to call by his own Name, and hath choſen for his own People (ſuch as were the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> in my Text, of old; and ſuch are all thoſe Peoples and Nations now that do profeſs his true Religion)? Certainly he hath.</p>
               <p>Thus natural reaſon will teach us to argue. And that it is a right way of arguing,<note place="margin">Matt. 6.26, 30. 1 Cor. 9.9.</note> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed to us by our Saviour and St. <hi>Paul,</hi> both of which we find reaſoning after this manner.</p>
               <p>To quote to you all that the Scripture ſaith upon this Argument, would be endleſs. One
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:63712:142"/>of the great deſigns of God's word, is to poſſeſs us with a hearty Belief, that God, as he is the Creator, ſo he is alſo the Governour of the World. And that his Providence ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to all the things and Perſons in it. And that the conſtant Rule and Meaſure of that Providence, is no other than the good of the World, and the good of every Perſon in it, ſo far as his private good is conſiſtent with the publick. And that therefore as God deſigns all good to every particular Man, ſo doth he more eſpecially deſign the good of Nations and Kingdoms in all his diſpenſations of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to them. Nor is there any thing happens in any Nation or Kingdom but with his approbation. Even the ſevereſt vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitations that come upon Mankind are from him. <hi>There is no evil happens to a City,</hi>

               <p>But then as for his own People, thoſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on whom his name is called, thoſe that are in Covenant with him, and profeſs his true Religion; for them upon all occaſions he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:63712:143"/>ſo great a tenderneſs and concernment; that there is hardly any figure of Speech that the moſt ſenſible Man can make uſe of, for the expreſſing his moſt paſſionate love to his deareſt Friend or Relation, though it be his Wife or his Children, but the very ſame figures are made uſe of by the Holy inſpired Writers to ſet out to us the kindneſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment that God hath for his own People. He is their <hi>God,</hi> their <hi>King,</hi> their <hi>Shepherd,</hi> their <hi>Father,</hi> their <hi>Husband.</hi> They are his <hi>choſen ones.</hi> His <hi>Delight,</hi> his <hi>peculiar Treaſure. He rejoiceth over them to do them good. His bowels earn, his heart is turned within him, his repentings are kindled together,</hi> when through their miſcarriages he is forced to paſs any ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere Sentence upon them. All this is the language of God in Scripture, when he ſpeaks of his People, and therefore we cannot doubt of his ſincere affection to them, and particular care of them.</p>
               <p>All the doubt is, whether theſe expreſſions ought to be applied to any other people than the Jews, with reſpect to whom the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture uſeth them. But we that believe the Goſpel, need not make much doubt of it. For it is certain, the reaſon of all theſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of kindneſs to the Jews more than to other Nations, was founded in this; That they were the People whom God had choſen to plant his Church among. They were the People where his Religion was
<pb n="179" facs="tcp:63712:143"/>owned. But now it is evident to all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, that after our Saviour came into the World, and Preached his Goſpel to all Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the Jews, as a <hi>Nation,</hi> ceaſed to be God's Church, or peculiar People; and from that time all thoſe Nations that embra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Chriſt's Religion, came into their place, and were from thence forward to be as dear to God, and as much his <hi>Care</hi> and his <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> as ever the Jews were. And, upon that account, we of this Nation, may, with as much reaſon, apply the expreſſions of Scripture to our ſelves, which declare God's kindneſs and concernment for his People, as ever the Jews did.</p>
               <p>Eſpecially conſidering that God has owned us of this Nation for his People, in as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable a manner as any Nation in Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtendom. As appears not only from that glorious light of the Goſpel, which he has for many years bleſſed us with, above any other people perhaps in the Chriſtian World: But alſo from the wonderful Providences, by which he has from time to time preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved our Church, and with it the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion among us, notwithſtanding the various attempts of our Enemies to ſubvert it. O may theſe Mercies of God to our Nation never be forgotten, and may we always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them with that due thankfulneſs they call for at our hands.</p>
               <pb n="180" facs="tcp:63712:144"/>
               <p>And thus much of our firſt Head. I beg leave to draw a practical Inference or two from what hath been ſaid, before I proceed to the other.</p>
               <p>Firſt, Since it appears, that God ſits at the Helm, and ſteers and manages all the affairs of Mankind; and that publick Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are more eſpecially the objects of his Care and Providence: Methinks this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration ſhould be a good Antidote againſt all thoſe troubleſome Fears and Sollicitude, we are apt to diſturb our ſelves with, about the ſucceſs of publick Matters.</p>
               <p>If indeed all things went in the World by Chance or Fate, and there was no God that did ſuperintend human Affairs; I ſhould think it very Natural for Men to be extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned at every piece of ill News they heard. It might be allowed them to break their ſleep in the night, and to complain diſmally in the day, of the ſad times that were coming upon us. But ſince we are certain, as much as we are certain there is a God, and as much as we are certain that the Scripture is true; that all our Affairs, our publick as well as our private Affairs; the Affairs both in Church and State, are entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in God Almighty's diſpoſal, and that <hi>He</hi> doth really manage and order all things a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us; and likewiſe ſo manageth them, that all ſhall at laſt turn to the good of his People, and to the good of every honeſt
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:63712:144"/>Man: I ſay, ſince we are, or may be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that our Buſineſs is in ſo good hands, I muſt confeſs I do not ſee what reaſon Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have, to give themſelves ſo much trouble and uneaſineſs, about things that may, or may not come.</p>
               <p>Thus far indeed, it is fit that every one ſhould be concerned; nay it is fit that every one ſhould charge his Conſcience with it: Namely, to do his Duty to the publick in his place and ſtation; to contribute all that is in his power towards the procuring and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the common Happineſs; and to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour all that in him lies, towards the avert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thoſe Judgments we have reaſon to fear. But when a Man hath done this, to what purpoſe is it for him to trouble himſelf any further? I ſhould think he had better follow our Saviour's advice, which, when all things be conſidered, will be found Eternally Pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and Reaſonable:<note place="margin">Matt. 6.34.</note> 
                  <hi>Take no thought for to morrow; let the morrow take care for the things of it ſelf: Sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Secondly, This Doctrine ought to teach us this farther Leſſon; to depend altogether upon God Almighty, and upon him only, for the good ſucceſs of our Affairs, either in Church or State, whenever they are in a doubtful or dangerous condition.<note place="margin">Prov. 19.21.</note> For <hi>though many are the devices in the hearts of men; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs the counſel of the Lord, that ſhall ſtand.</hi>
                  <pb n="182" facs="tcp:63712:145"/>It is in vain to truſt humane means: For be our ſtrength never ſo great; or be thoſe that manage for us never ſo induſtrious; or be our hearts never ſo much united: Yet it is an eaſy matter for God to blaſt all our deſigns, and to diſappoint all our Counſels in a Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>He hath often done ſo, where Men have been confident in their own ſtrength.<note place="margin">2 Kings 19.34.</note> In one night's time he made that prodigious Army of <hi>Aſſyrians,</hi> that came up againſt <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem,</hi> and thought themſelves ſure of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king it; to decamp and fly back into their own Country, leaving a hundred and four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fcore thouſand of their number Dead upon the place.</p>
               <p>There is in truth no truſting to an <hi>Arm of Fleſh.</hi> For the ſucceſſes of War depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a thouſand Contingencies, which it is not in the power of mortal Men, either to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, or remedy.<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 9.11. Pſal. 33.16.</note> So that <hi>the race is not always to the ſwift, nor the battel to the ſtrong; nor can a King be ſav'd by the multitude of an Hoſt, nor any mighty Man be delivered by his much ſtrength.</hi> But the <hi>God of Heaven that ruleth in the Kingdoms of Men;</hi> it is He that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves or deſtroys; that gives Victory, or ſends a Defeat, as it pleaſeth him. And therefore he is, by way of eminence, ſtiled, <hi>The Lord of Hoſts,</hi> the God of Battels.</p>
               <p>On the other hand, If our Affairs at any time be in ſo very bad a poſture, that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not
<pb n="183" facs="tcp:63712:145"/>not avoid the having a melancholy diſmal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of things; yet let us not be diſcouraged, let us ſtill truſt in God; let us do what be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to us to do for the obtaining his Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Favour, and then refer the Event to him. God hath certainly a kindneſs for his People, and if we do our parts towards the preſerving his Affection to us, we may ſtill hope he will continue to be our Saviour and Deliverer.</p>
               <p>Is is as eaſy to God <hi>to ſave by few as by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny;</hi> the Walls of <hi>Jericho,</hi> at his Command,<note place="margin">Joſh. 6.20.</note> fell down flat, only at the ſound of Rams-Horns.<note place="margin">2 Kings 7. ch.</note> And when the City of <hi>Samaria</hi> was Beſieged, and brought into the greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity that was poſſible, ſo that Women even are their own Children: yet in one night, God by an unaccountable terrour, which he ſtruck into the hearts of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies, raiſed the Siege. And ſuch plenty was left in their Camp, that every one of the Beſieged had wherewith, not only to ſatisfy his hunger, but to enrich himſelf. Only that Nobleman that would not believe this when it was foretold by the Prophet, did not live to taſte of the Fruits of God Almighty's Victory, being trodden to Death in the Crowd.</p>
               <p n="2">II. But it is time to come to the ſecond general point I obſerved from this Text; <hi>viz. That the Happineſs and Proſperity of Nations, is to be attained the ſame way that any particular
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:63712:146"/>Man's happineſs is;</hi> that is to ſay, <hi>by being ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely virtuous and religious;</hi> or, as my Text expreſſes it, <hi>by fearing God, and keeping all his Commandments always.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is a true Propoſition, both with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to particular Perſons and to Nations too; but with this difference, That if we take Happineſs and Proſperity for that which the World accounts ſo, that is to ſay, the poſſeſſion of a great many outward Bleſſings, and the freedom from temporal evils and inconveniencies; the Propoſition is not ſo univerſally true with reference to <hi>particular Perſons,</hi> as it is with reference to <hi>Nations</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms.</hi> For every Man that fears God is not always bleſſed with happy outward Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. On the contrary, ſome good Men are expoſed to many and great Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and Misfortunes, and Sickneſſes, and Croſſes, all their lives long. But it is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly true of all <hi>Nations</hi> and <hi>Peoples</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever. Every Nation or Society ſhall fare better or worſe in this World, exactly, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording as they fear God, or deſpiſe and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front him; exactly, according to the degree they keep God's Commandments, or break them. Though it is not certain, that every particular Man ſhall always do ſo. And there is great reaſon that it ſhould be thus. For</p>
               <pb n="185" facs="tcp:63712:146"/>
               <p>Firſt, We know that all God's ways are juſt and equal. Now as to <hi>particular Perſons,</hi> there is a great room left for the diſpenſing this Juſtice and Equity to them. For they being in their natures made to live for ever, it is enough for the vindicating God's Juſtice, that they be at any time hereafter, either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded for their Piety and Virtue, or pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for their Wickedneſs and abuſe of God's Mercies. So that wicked Men may be hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py and proſperous here, and good Men may ſuffer many afflictions and tribulations, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any the leaſt reflection on the Juſtice or Goodneſs of the great Governour of the World: Becauſe there is a farther day reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved for the adjuſting all Men's Rewards ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their Works.</p>
               <p>But now the conſideration of publick <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties</hi> and <hi>Nations,</hi> is quite different. Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are not made to be Immortal, but end with this World. No Society, as a Society, ſhall be called to a future account. But all the Rewards and Puniſhments, they are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of as Societies, muſt be adjudged and diſtributed to them in this preſent Life. And therefore if we ſuppoſe God to be the Judge and Governour of the World, and of all the Nations in it; as well as he is the Judge and Governour of particular Perſons: We muſt likewiſe ſuppoſe, that he admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters all affairs ſo, that Righteous and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious Nations have in this World the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward
<pb n="186" facs="tcp:63712:147"/>of their Virtue in the bleſſings of Peace and Plenty, and all manner of tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Proſperity: And on the other ſide, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious and incorrigible Nations are likewiſe puniſhed in this World for their wickedneſs, either by ſevere Judgments, or by a total deſtruction; as God in his infinite Wiſdom ſees cauſe.</p>
               <p>This now that I have offered is I think ſo reaſonable, that if there was no more to be ſaid, it ought to go a great way towards the making of the point I have in hand highly credible. But in the <hi>ſecond</hi> place there is a great deal more to be ſaid. The word of God doth all along bear teſtimony to the truth of this. A multitude of Texts of Scripture there are, that do moſt plainly give this account of God's dealing with Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Peoples, that I have now mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.</p>
               <p>There is no Judgment threatned to any Nation in the holy Scripture (and abundance of Nations are there threatned) but it is up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on account of the ſins and wickedneſs they were guilty of. Which Sins, if they repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted of, ſo repented as to forſake them, they might find mercy.</p>
               <p>And accordingly we find in fact, that God always dealt with Peoples and Nations according to theſe meaſures. God had ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly denounced deſtruction to the City of <hi>Nineveh,</hi> by his Prophet, and that within
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:63712:147"/>forty Days. But upon the Repentance of the <hi>Ninevites,</hi> and turning to God with all their hearts, he reverſed his Sentence (tho' to the great diſcontent of the Prophet) and gave them a further time.</p>
               <p>On the other ſide he waited long for the Repentance of the <hi>Canaanites,</hi> but would not deſtroy them; becauſe their ſins, though very heinous, admitted a place for Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. But when their iniquities were fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led up to the meaſures, according to which God proceeds in his deſtruction of Nations; He then ſent the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> to root them out, and to take poſſeſſion of their Land.</p>
               <p>And thus was <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> raiſed up by God to be a ſcourge to all the Nations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout him, for the puniſhment of their ſins. <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> had indeed other things in his Head. That which he deſigned was, the gratifying his own Ambition, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larging his Dominions. But theſe were not the ends which God had to ſerve by him. God made uſe of him as his Inſtrument, as his Servant, (and ſo he calls him) for the rendring to the Nations that juſt recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of vengeance which their ſins called for.</p>
               <p>I mention theſe things the rather, becauſe they are inſtances of God's dealing with Heathen Nations, who were under no par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Covenant with God.</p>
               <pb n="188" facs="tcp:63712:148"/>
               <p>And I might have recourſe likewiſe to the Hiſtories of all Nations, to ſhew the truth of this. Name any Nation that was ever remarkable for Juſtice; for Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and ſeverity of Manners; for Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Religion (though it was in a wrong way); that did not always thrive and grow great in the World; and that did not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways enjoy a plentiful portion of all thoſe things which are accounted to make a Nation happy and flouriſhing. And on the other ſide, when that Nation has declined from its former Virtue, and grown impious or diſſolute in manners, we appeal to Experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, whether it has not likewiſe always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably ſunk in its Succeſs and good For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. I am ſure any one that will be at the pains to read either the <hi>Greek,</hi> or the <hi>Roman,</hi> or even the <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Hiſtory, will meet with matter enough there to ſatisfie him of the truth of this obſervation.</p>
               <p>But I confine my ſelf to the Scripture, and in that the Hiſtory of the <hi>Jews</hi> is the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable, for indeed it makes up a great part of the Old Teſtament. Now in that Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtory it is worth our taking notice of; That every degree of publick Vice, and departure from God's Laws, was always puniſhed with publick Judgments. And on the other ſide, every degree of publick Repentance and Reformation, was always rewarded with publick Happineſs and Proſperity. So
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:63712:148"/>that any one that could make a right eſtimate of the Morals of that Nation, and how it ſtood as to Virtue and Vice; might conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly make a judgment likewiſe how it would fare with them, as to their outward tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affairs.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs that generally ſpeaking, there is little force in thoſe Arguments that are drawn from Examples; But in the caſe I am now upon, I think there is a great weight in them. For though we cannot argue from God's dealing with one Perſon, that he will juſt deal in the ſame manner with another: Yet as to Nations and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, the caſe is otherwiſe, as I before ſaid. For God's Diſpenſations and Providences to them, ſeem all to proceed upon one immu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Foundation (which will be the ſame in all Ages and Countries) namely the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and vindication of his Juſtice and Goodneſs in this World.</p>
               <p>And for my part, I have always been of this mind, That there is no other difference between the Hiſtory of God's dealings with his own People the Jews, and that of other Nations, but this: That in other Nations the publick Events that happened, whether good or bad, though they were taken notice of, yet they paſſed without any reflection on the true cauſes from whence they proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Hiſtorians did indeed often lay their Fingers rightly upon the immediate,
<pb n="190" facs="tcp:63712:149"/>viſible, outward occaſions, or means, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, from whence their good or bad Fortune was derived to them. But they ſearched no further. They conſidered on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſecond Cauſes, and took no great notice of the firſt and principal Cauſe of all things, God Almighty, and his influencing humane affairs. They left God in a great meaſure out of their Hypotheſis, and out of their Hiſtory. But now that the World might be awakened to a more hearty belief and ſenſe of his Providence, God took care to ſingle out the Nation of the Jews; and in them to give us a true Pattern or Platform of his dealings with all the Nations of the World. And for that purpoſe he ordered, that all the great ſtrokes, both of their departure from God, and of their return to him; and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe both of the good or bad Fortune, that did at any time befal that Nation, ſhould be faithfully Regiſtred, and the true Cauſes of them faithfully aſſigned; That all Mankind might from thence receive Inſtruction how they ought to behave themſelves towards God; and what according to their different behaviours they were to expect.</p>
               <p>To conclude this point: By all that hath been ſaid it appears, That the State, and Condition, and Fortune of all Kingdoms and Nations, is the very ſame with that of the Jews, as it is repreſented by <hi>Achior</hi> the <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monite,</hi> in the advice he gave to <hi>Holofernes,</hi>
                  <pb n="191" facs="tcp:63712:149"/>when he came up with an Army againſt that People. You have the paſſage in <hi>Judith</hi> 5.17. <hi>Whilst</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>theſe People ſinned not before their God, they proſpered; becauſe the God that hateth iniquity was with them. But when they departed from the way that he appointed them, they were deſtroyed in many Battels, after a nonderful ſort, and were led Captive into a land that was not theirs. But now they are turned to their God, and are come up from their Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and have again poſſeſſed</hi> Jeruſalem. <hi>Now therefore my Lord and Governour, if there be any fault in this People, ſo that they have ſinned against their God, let us conſider that this ſhall be their ruin, and let us go up that we may overcome them. But if there be no ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity in this People, let my Lord paſs by, leſt their Lord defend them, and their God be for them, and we become a reproach before all the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus it is, and will be always with all States and Nations, if they notoriouſly ſin againſt their God, this will be their ruin. But if there be not found iniquity in them, it is in vain for any Enemy to ſet upon them; for God will be for them, and their Lord will defend them.</p>
               <p>If this which I have ſaid be not ſufficient to ſatisfie any one about the truth of this point, I might bring other Proofs for it. I might for inſtance, in the <hi>third</hi> place, inſiſt upon this, That Virtue and Piety do, in their
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:63712:150"/>own nature tend to promote the welfare and happineſs of Peoples and Nations. As, on the other hand, all Vice and Irreligion, is deſtructive of humane Society. And this without reſpect to any appointment or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of God, that things ſhould be managed in this way; but purely in the very nature of the thing.</p>
               <p>It is obvious, That Virtue and Religion lay the ſureſt Foundation for all thoſe Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings wherein the happineſs of a Nation doth conſiſt that is poſſible; both by making Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates to govern well, and by rendring the People eaſie to be governed. And like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe by furniſhing both the Governours and the governed, with ſuch kind of Principles and Habits as cannot fail with the Bleſſing of God to produce both Peace, and Plenty, and Victory, and all other ſorts of Proſperity in a Nation.</p>
               <p>As on the other hand, all Vice, and Wickedneſs, and Profaneneſs, and Impiety, do ſow the worſt Seeds in the World for the diſſolving and breaking in pieces all So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties; or at leaſt, for the ſo enfeebling them, that they ſhall either be in a very low wretched condition among themſelves, if they have no Enemies; or if they have any, become an eaſie prey to the next In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vader.</p>
               <p>But I will not enter upon this Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, becauſe I think the matter needs no
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:63712:150"/>further proof, And I would ſpend the reſt of my time, in making ſome Application of what hath been ſaid upon this point, to the buſineſs of our preſent meeting on this Day.</p>
               <p>WE are here met together for the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Humiliation of our ſelves with <hi>Faſting</hi> and <hi>Prayer,</hi> before Almighty God: In order to the Supplicating his Divine Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty for the Pardon of our Sins, and the Sins of our Nation; And the imploring his Bleſſing and Protection to the King and Kingdom, by continuing thoſe Mercies to us we do injoy; by averting thoſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments from us we have reaſon to fear, and more particularly by giving a Happy Iſſue to that dangerous War in which his Majeſty, with the Kingdom, is now engaged.</p>
               <p>And very great reaſon there is, that you the <hi>Repreſentatives</hi> of the People of <hi>England,</hi> ſhould moſt ſeriouſly, and ſolemnly join in this Religious Office; ſince the Fortunes of the Nation you repreſent, did never more lie at ſtake, than at this preſent.</p>
               <p>You have hitherto been acting and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring for the Happineſs and Security of your Nation by <hi>Humane</hi> Methods, and we all put up our daily Prayers, that what you have done, and what you ſhall do, may be <hi>for the Glory of God, and the good of his Church; and the Safety, Honour, and Well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:63712:151"/>of their Majeſties and their Kingdoms.</hi> And we hope all will ſo come to paſs.</p>
               <p>But now on this Day, both <hi>You</hi> and <hi>We,</hi> are to think of other Methods, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing Succeſs to our Affairs. Namely, by having recourſe to God Almighty; who, when we have done all that we can, is the Governour of the World, and will do what he pleaſeth. But yet will always do that which is beſt for Mankind, and that too which is beſt for our Nation, if we be capable Objects of his Favour. And to make our ſelves ſuch, if it be poſſible, is our buſineſs on this Day.</p>
               <p>This is indeed a ſeaſonable Buſineſs at all times; but at this time it ſeems abſolutely neceſſary. Since we have reaſon to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the <hi>Criſis</hi> of our Nation, as to <hi>Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> or <hi>Ruin,</hi> to be upon the point of approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>The Judgments of God are now abroad in the World. We have not only Rumours of Wars ſounding in our Ears, but all <hi>Europs</hi> is now in an actual War, and a terrible one. And what the Conſequences will be, we know not.</p>
               <p>Some very great thing God certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns to bring to paſs in theſe parts of the World, and that very ſuddenly. A Cup he has mingled for all the Nations to drink of. Which to ſome undoubtedly will prove a bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Potion, a <hi>Cup</hi> of God's <hi>Wrath</hi> and <hi>Fury;</hi>
                  <pb n="195" facs="tcp:63712:151"/>to others probably a <hi>Cup of Salvation.</hi> But how it will prove to us, is yet entirely in the Will of God. However this is certain, that we of this Nation ſhall have as much our ſhare in it, be it good or bad, as any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in Chriſtendom.</p>
               <p>And now after the mention of this, Can there be any need to call upon any one to <hi>weeping</hi> and <hi>faſting,</hi> and <hi>mourning,</hi> and <hi>crying mightily to the Lord, that he would have mercy upon us, and ſpare us,</hi> and our Nation, and <hi>not give his Heritage over to Confuſion?</hi> Why methinks the Circumſtances we are in, ſhould put us upon ſo doing, without any other Monitors. Indeed we have no Humanity, no Compaſſion for our ſelves or our Country, if we do not.</p>
               <p>We ſhould all be of this mind, if we did ſeriouſly conſider how things ſtand with us.</p>
               <p>We are not that Innocent, Virtuous, Pious People, that may certainly reckon upon God's Favour, and think our ſelves in all Caſes ſure of his Protection. For if the Doctrine I have now been inſiſting on to you, be true Doctrine; then we of this Nation can but entertain very ſmall hopes of being Happy and Proſperous. Nay, we cannot but appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend Miſery and Ruin, and Deſolation to our ſelves; unleſs God be abundantly more merciful to us than we deſerve. And there can be no way to prevail with him to be ſo,
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:63712:152"/>but an univerſal <hi>Humiliation</hi> and <hi>Repentance.</hi> And this is the Application I deſire to make of the Point I have been now treating of.</p>
               <p>If the meaſure of God's dealing with Nations be always according to the <hi>Moral</hi> State of them. If their <hi>good Fortunes</hi> be dealt out to them according to their <hi>Virtues;</hi> and <hi>Judgments</hi> be inflicted upon them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their provoking God by their <hi>Sins;</hi> as we have ſaid: Good Lord! What a lamentable Proſpect have we of this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of what may come upon us? And what infinite reaſon have we thereupon, imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to try all the ways that are poſſible of making our Peace with God, that ſo <hi>Ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity may not be our ruin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I beg leave to dwell a little upon this Point, becauſe it is the proper Argument of the day.</p>
               <p>I do not ſay, nor do I think, that we of this Nation are worſe than our Neighbours. But this I ſay, conſidering how long God hath ſpared us, and how long we have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed the Bleſſings of Peace and Plenty, and all ſorts of Proſperity (though perhaps with many Fears and juſt Apprehenſions of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger); whilſt moſt of our Neighbours have been haraſſed with Wars, and expoſed to all the Cruelties and Miſeries of Perſecutions and Devaſtations: And conſidering the great Priviledges and Advantages we have for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny years enjoyed, of all the outward <hi>means</hi>
                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:63712:152"/>of <hi>Grace,</hi> that could be deſired for the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation of our Souls, and that above any other Nation under Heaven; And with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, how unprofitable we have been under theſe <hi>means,</hi> how unthankful to God for them, and what little Effect they have had upon us for the bettering our Manners. And laſtly, Conſidering how very wicked we generally are, what a World of open groſs Sins and Impieties do reign among us, and what a lewd, Prophane, Hypocritical, Atheiſtical Spirit ſeems to have gone out into the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and to prevail upon it. I ſay, theſe things conſidered, we cannot make any very comfortable Reflections on our own Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So far from that, that if (as I ſaid) the meaſure of God's dealings with Nations be taken from their Behaviours and moral Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, and be ſuited to their merits and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerts; we have as little to hope for, as moſt Nations under Heaven.</p>
               <p>I take no delight in ſaying theſe things; on the contrary it is very grievous: But if ever one may be allowed to run out into a <hi>Declamation</hi> againſt the <hi>Vices</hi> of the <hi>Times,</hi> it is upon ſuch an occaſion as this, and before ſuch an Audience as this, that the liberty may be challenged.</p>
               <p>For God's ſake let us not deceive our ſelves nor think that we are Favourites of Heaven, meerly becauſe we profeſs the <hi>Beſt Religion,</hi> and are Members of the <hi>Beſt Church</hi> in the World.</p>
               <pb n="198" facs="tcp:63712:153"/>
               <p>For as good as our Church and Religion is, and as zealous as we ſeem to be for them; yet never did <hi>Vice</hi> and <hi>Iniquity</hi> of all ſorts, and indeed every thing that is contrary to our holy Religion, more abound in this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion than at this day.</p>
               <p>Give me leave to ſpeak out upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and to tell you of ſome of the <hi>Crying Sins</hi> that reign among us, and that deſerve <hi>Your Care</hi> to put a ſtop to; and which, if if they be continued in, will certainly bring down the Vengeance of God upon us.</p>
               <p>Where was there ever more <hi>Atheiſm</hi> and <hi>Inſidelity</hi> to be ſeen in a Country that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed the Religion of Jeſus Chriſt, than is among us at this day?</p>
               <p>We do not perhaps meet with very many that do openly affirm, <hi>There is no God:</hi> For as bad as we are, God be thanked we are not yet arrived to ſuch Impudence. That is ſuch an affront to the <hi>Laws</hi> and <hi>good Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners,</hi> that it is not to be born with. But we may meet with ſeveral, every day, that do affirm the ſame thing by conſequence; aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ſuch Principles from whence it may be neceſſarily concluded.</p>
               <p>For my part, I account it much the ſame thing, as to the ill effects of the Opinion, to deny the Being of <hi>God;</hi> as to deny the Being of <hi>Angels,</hi> and <hi>Spirits,</hi> and <hi>Immaterial Souls,</hi> to deny the Being of <hi>particular Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence;</hi> to deny the natural difference between
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:63712:153"/>
                  <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil;</hi> to deny another Life after this, wherein good Men ſhall be rewarded, and wicked Men puniſhed; to deny the liberty of <hi>Humane Actions,</hi> and to ſay, that all things which we do, we do by a fatal neceſſity, and we cannot do otherwiſe: And yet we may every day meet with Men of theſe Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, nay, and that laugh at all thoſe that maintain the contrary.</p>
               <p>But then, as for the buſineſs of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and that which we call the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, what a very little do a great many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us make of that? To talk of Chriſt's being ſent for the Saviour of the World, and that he died to procure the Pardon of our Sins, and that we muſt believe all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Doctrines concerning him, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him as a God; why what <hi>ſtuff</hi> is this to a great many of the reſined Spirits of our Age? It is very well if they can ſo far pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with themſelves, as to own the Being of God, and to acknowledge their obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Duties of moral Honeſty and Juſtice, which <hi>natural</hi> Religion teacheth: But as for <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Trinity,</hi> and the <hi>Sacraments,</hi> and all <hi>revealed</hi> Religion; they beg your Pardon for theſe things, they are too nice and ſubtil for them to meddle with. Not but that they are good Chriſtians all the while. For they can come to our Churches, and to our Sacraments too, if there be occaſion. Becauſe indeed they will
<pb n="200" facs="tcp:63712:154"/>always be of the Religion of the Country where they live. But at the ſame time they do this; they do no more really believe, or expect any Spiritual Benefit in our Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, nor look for any more <hi>Salvation</hi> from <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> than they would expect from <hi>Mahomet,</hi> if they ſhould live in <hi>Turky.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this is not all. Even among thoſe that do believe in Jeſus Chriſt, and own his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; yet what little regard have they, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſpeaking, to his Worſhip and Service.</p>
               <p>It is very well if they now and then af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford their preſence on <hi>Sundays</hi> at the publick Religious Aſſemblies. I will not examine with what deſigns, and for what ends they come thither, nor how devoutly and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly their hearts are affected during the time they are there. I ſay it is very well that they are there at all.</p>
               <p>But even of thoſe that do come thither, and do once a Week ſeem to have a ſenſe of publick Religion, I ſay how few are there of them that take any care of worſhipping God, either in their <hi>Families,</hi> or in their <hi>Cloſets?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Why, if a Man was truly Religious, he could not paſs a day without ſolemn Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to his <hi>Maker,</hi> and to his <hi>Redeemer.</hi> He would pray in his Cloſet conſtantly; and if he had a Family, he would Pray with them conſtantly. And if he had no Family, he would conſtantly reſort to thoſe places where
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:63712:154"/>he might pay his Tribute of publick Prayer and Praiſes to God, unleſs he had urgent bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs to hinder him.</p>
               <p>But, is there any thing of this to be ſeen among us, except in ſome few Perſons here and there? Are there not twenty Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies for one that live without ſo much as the ſhew of any Devotion? Without any ſort of Prayer or Worſhip of God in their Houſes? Nay, and I am afraid, I may ſay, there are twenty for one, even of Private Perſons, that live without Devotion in their Cloſets; that never call upon God, never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new their Vows to their Saviour, never pay him any Homage, except perhaps once a Week in a formal way, when the Cuſtom of the Country obliges them to reſort to the Church.</p>
               <p>The truth is, ſo little ſenſe have moſt of us of Religion and Devotion; ſo little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of our Duty to God, and our depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon him, and expreſſing that depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance, either in Private, or in our Families: That were it not for that <hi>Happy</hi> Inſtitution of the <hi>Lord's day,</hi> on the which we are obliged, by the Laws of God and Man, to meet to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether for the Worſhip of God; we ſhould hardly ſee any Face of Religon among us, and in a little time ſhould ſcarce be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from Heathens.</p>
               <p>But yet this is not the worſt of our Caſe. Our groſs <hi>Immoralities;</hi> that Horrid <hi>Lewdneſs</hi>
                  <pb n="202" facs="tcp:63712:155"/>and <hi>Debauchery</hi> that is every where to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved in our days, doth ſtill increaſe our Guilt, and cry to Heaven for Judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our Nation.</p>
               <p>It would make a Man's heart ake, that has any ſenſe of God or Religion, to think of the <hi>Riots,</hi> the <hi>Drunkenneſs,</hi> the continued courſe of ſpending our Time, and our Parts, and our Subſtance, in <hi>Revelling</hi> and <hi>Gaming,</hi> and all manner of ſuch exceſſes that is daily practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed among us. And yet at the ſame time, the Men that thus live, think themſelves very honeſt Men all the while.</p>
               <p>It would really amaze a Man, and put him upon admiring God's Patience, that he doth not preſently confound the World, if he did ſeriouſly reflect on the many <hi>filthy, lewd</hi> Speeches and Actions, the numerous wicked intrigues of <hi>Lust,</hi> the Infamous <hi>Whoredoms</hi> and <hi>Adulteries</hi> that are, without any ſenſe of ſhame, daily carried on and acted among us, and that by Perſons too that have the Face to ſhew themſelves at our Holy Aſſemblies.</p>
               <p>Eſpecially, if to theſe be added, the infinite <hi>Lyes,</hi> and <hi>Cheats,</hi> and <hi>Perjuries</hi> which our Land groans under. The Blaſphemous <hi>Oaths</hi> and <hi>Imprecations,</hi> the <hi>Damn me's</hi> and <hi>Sink me's;</hi> the Horrid Profanations of the Name of God, and all things Sacred, that are in every place, in every ſtreet where we paſs, bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched out, in contempt of the <hi>Almighty</hi> and
<pb n="203" facs="tcp:63712:155"/>his Laws; by all ſorts of <hi>Perſons,</hi> of all ſorts of <hi>Qualities;</hi> from the <hi>Beggar</hi> in the ſtreet to the <hi>Man</hi> of <hi>Honour,</hi> and that for no other reaſon in the World, but becauſe it is their Humour or their Cuſtom,</p>
               <p>And laſtly, to fill up the meaſure of our iniquities; to our other reigning Vices, we have added that of <hi>Hypocriſie</hi> too; which one would think ſhould not often be found among ſo much <hi>Profaneneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How many of us make a mighty noiſe with <hi>Religion,</hi> and are zealous even to <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gottry,</hi> in the defence of it, and yet have not one grain of inward ſenſe of what it obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geth them to. Nay ſo far from that, that if <hi>Religion</hi> be but in their Mouths: If they do but appear Zealous enough for the <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Cauſe:</hi> If they can but cry loue enough, <hi>The Temple of the Lord, The Temple of the Lord,</hi> as the Jews did in the Prophet; They matter not how coutradictory their Actions are to the Precepts of that Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion they do Profeſs. Their Zeal for ſo good a Cauſe, will ſanctifie all the other Actions, be they never ſo wicked and unjuſt.</p>
               <p>But if this be not <hi>Hypocriſie,</hi> there is no ſuch thing in the World. Sure I am, it was this ſort of Carriage, that God ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves the Jews for, by his Prophets; and upon account of which they are ſo often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached as a Generation of <hi>Hypocrites,</hi> and
<pb n="204" facs="tcp:63712:156"/>for which he threatens them with utter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction.</p>
               <p>O my Brethren, what have we to ſay to theſe things? If the Caſe be thus with us, as I am afraid it is; What plea have we to put in for our ſelves? If God ſhould let looſe our Enemies upon us, the Enemies of our <hi>Nation,</hi> and of our <hi>Religion,</hi> and ſhould give us over as a Prey unto them, what have we to reply? Truly nothing that I know of, except that of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Righteous art thou, O Lord, and Just are thy Judgments.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But we truſt God's Lenity and Forbear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and Mercy is as great to <hi>Publick So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms,</hi> as it is to <hi>Private Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons;</hi> And, that we may apply thoſe expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions to our Nation which <hi>David</hi> uttered with reference to himſelf: <hi>O Lord if thou ſhouldst be extream to mark what is done amiſs, O Lord who may abide it? But there is Mercy with thee, that thou mayest be feared.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When the Iniquities of a People are at the full, God will not fail to puniſh them. But whether ours be ſo or no, He only knows. We hope, though they be very <hi>grievous</hi> and <hi>crying,</hi> they have not yet exceeded the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of God's Patience; and that there is yet left a place for Repentance. This is indeed the only <hi>Plank</hi> we have to truſt to, that can ſave us from <hi>Shipwrack;</hi> and therefore we ought to lay hold upon it.</p>
               <pb n="205" facs="tcp:63712:156"/>
               <p>Let us therefore this day, every one of us; if we have any kindneſs for our Native Country: If we have any reſpect to that dear Place, where we and our Anceſtors, and all our Relations and Kindred for many Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations have lived ſo happily:</p>
               <p>If we have any Zeal for, or regard to that excellent <hi>Church,</hi> and that Holy <hi>Religion,</hi> that God did in ſo extraordinary a manner plant among us; and for the preſerving of which in our Land, His Care and Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence hath ſo often and ſo wonderfully ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared:</p>
               <p>If we have any Concernment for many thouſands of innocent Souls, who without their own fault may deeply ſuffer for the Nations Sins:</p>
               <p>Laſtly, If we have any Bowels of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion to thoſe dear Children of ours, that God hath given us, that we may tranſmit to them and their Children after them, that <hi>Birth-Right,</hi> and thoſe <hi>Privileges,</hi> and that excellent <hi>Religion</hi> we received from our Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers:</p>
               <p>I ſay, if we have any ſenſe of theſe things, let every one of us this day, moſt ſincerely apply our ſelves to the Service of God, in all the ways of a ſerious Virtue and Piety. Or if we have been careleſs of this matter here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore; or which is worſe, have been lewd or wicked in our lives; yet let us now at laſt heartily repent of it. And with <hi>Prayers</hi>
                  <pb n="206" facs="tcp:63712:157"/>and <hi>Tears,</hi> and the moſt ſolemn <hi>Reſolutions</hi> of <hi>Amendment,</hi> proſtrate our ſelves before the Throne of Grace; imploring and beſeeching God's Pardon and Forgiveneſs, and, if it be poſſible, <hi>a lengthning of our Tranquillity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O let us not refuſe this opportunity of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the greateſt Kindneſs, and the beſt ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to our Country, that we poſſibly can. And therefore let us not only heartily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wail our own Sins, but the reigning Impie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Wickedneſs, that our Nation ſtands accountable for.</p>
               <p>Now is the time, if ever, that we are all concerned to be importunate with God for our ſelves and our Country.</p>
               <p>And a fitter <hi>Prayer</hi> for this purpoſe can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be compoſed for us, than that which <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> put up to God for his Nation, and that at ſuch a ſolemn time as this, when, as he tells us, he had <hi>ſet himſelf to ſeek God for his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, by Prayer and Supplication, with Faſting, and Sackcloth and Aſhes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Prayer is in the 9<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Chapter of his Prophecy; and I ſhall conclude with it, and I earneſtly beg of you all to join with me in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>O Lord, the great and dreadful God, that keepest the Covenant, and ſhewest mercy to them that love thee, and to them that keep thy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments.</hi>

                     <p>Finally, Brethren, whatſoever things are true, whatſoever things are ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest, whatſoever things are just, whatſoever things are pure, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever things are lovely, whatſoever things are of good report; if there be any vertue, and if there be any praiſe, think on theſe things.</p>

               <p>I Have the two laſt Lord's Days made it my buſineſs to treat of this Text, in a way that I thought did moſt tend to the informing your Judgments: And to that
<pb n="210" facs="tcp:63712:159"/>purpoſe I have raiſed ſeveral Obſervations, and drawn ſeveral inferences from it.</p>
               <p>I mean now to treat of it in another way, and apply my ſelf wholly to the preſſing you to the practice of it.</p>
               <p>And indeed the Nature of the Sermon I am to make, doth call for this from me. For I am now to take my leave of you; this being the laſt time, in all probability, that I ſhall Preach among you as your Miniſter: And therefore I ſuppoſe good Advice and Exhortation will more become me at this time, than a cloſe Diſcourſe upon a Text.</p>
               <p>And yet, my Text doth afford matter enough, without ſtraining it, for ſuch a pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: Nor indeed do I know a Text in the Bible, that I could more willingly pitch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to leave with you, as the laſt Advice I would give you, and as the Sum and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of my Preaching among you; than theſe Words of St. <hi>Paul</hi> I have now read to you.</p>
               <p>Let me therefore at this time addreſs my ſelf to you all, as the Apoſtle here did at the concluſion of his Epiſtle to the <hi>Philippi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Finally, Brethren, whatſoever things are true,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>Here are a great many things recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the Apoſtle to our thoughts and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit. If we would make a diſtribution of them, I believe they will all naturally enough full under theſe <hi>Four</hi> Heads. For the
<pb n="211" facs="tcp:63712:159"/>
                  <hi>things</hi> here recommended are not ſo many as the <hi>words</hi> by which they are expreſs'd, there being ſeveral Words uſed in this Enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meration, that are of the ſame importance, and ſeem to expreſs much the ſame thing.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Four</hi> Heads I would reduce them to are theſe,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. <hi>A conſtant Adherence to the true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>II. <hi>Honeſty and Juſtice in our Dealings.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>III. <hi>A Life of Strict</hi> Purity, <hi>in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to</hi> Senſuality <hi>and</hi> Lewdneſs.</item>
                  <item>IV. <hi>The adorning the Doctrine of God we do profeſs, by the conſtant Practice of every other thing that is Virtuous or Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendable, or well thought of by Mankind.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>This, as I take it, is a fair account of the Parts of this Text: and theſe I ſhall make the Heads of my following Exhortation.</p>
               <p>I begin with the firſt. <hi>Finally, my Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, whatſoever things are true, think on thoſe things.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Truths</hi> that St. <hi>Paul</hi> here exhorts them to think on are undoubtedly the <hi>Truths</hi> of the Goſpel of Jeſus Chriſt, which he had delivered to them. Theſe he would have them to think upon, and perſiſt in, and never to be prevailed upon by any Temptation to depart from them.</p>
               <pb n="212" facs="tcp:63712:160"/>
               <p>Let me now apply this Advice of his to you. It is the particular Bleſſing of God to this Kingdom, and an ineſtimable Bleſſing it is, that he has not only vouchſafed us the Light of his Goſpel for many years, but he has alſo taken Care that the <hi>Truths</hi> of it ſhould be delivered to us with greater Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Sincerity, and freer from the mixtures of Errour than to moſt, I was going to ſay than to any other People in the World.</p>
               <p>If it lay in your way to make obſervations concerning the State of Religion in other Countries; nay, or but to read the Accounts that are given of it: I am ſure you would be convinced how exceedingly happy we of this Church are, above all the Churches in Chriſtendom.</p>
               <p>O therefore let us all firmly adhere to the <hi>Truths</hi> we have been taught; to the <hi>Truths</hi> we have hitherto made Profeſſion of. And let us firmly adhere to that <hi>Church</hi> which hath held forth theſe <hi>Truths</hi> to us, and taught us this Profeſſion.</p>
               <p>We do not pretend that any Church is In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible, and therefore not ours: But this we dare ſay, and we can juſtifie; that if we take our meaſures concerning the Truths of Religion from the Rules of the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and the Platform of the Primitive Churches, the Church of <hi>England</hi> is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, both as to Doctrine and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, the Pureſt Church that is at this day in
<pb n="213" facs="tcp:63712:160"/>the World; the moſt Orthodox in Faith, and the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>eſt on the one hand from <hi>Idolatry</hi> and <hi>Superſtition,</hi> and on the other hand from <hi>Freakiſhneſs</hi> and <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> of any now extant.</p>
               <p>Nay I do farther ſay with great ſeriouſneſs, and as one that expects to be called to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count at the dreadful Tribunal of God for what I now ſay, if I do not ſpeak in ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity: That I do in my Conſcience believe, that if the Religion of Jeſus Chriſt, as it is delivered in the New Teſtament, be the true Religion (as I am certain it is:) Then the Communion of the Church of <hi>England</hi> is a ſafe way to Salvation, and the ſafeſt of any I know in the World.</p>
               <p>And therefore I do exhort you all in the Name of God, ſteadfaſtly to hold and to perſevere in this Communion.</p>
               <p>Here you have the <hi>Things that are true.</hi> Think of them and embrace them heartily; and Live and Die in the Profeſſion of them. This is the Doctrine I have always Taught you, and by the Grace of God I mean to Practiſe accordingly.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The next thing I have to recommend to you from theſe words of the Apoſtle, is Univerſal <hi>Honeſty</hi> and <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> in your Converſation. <hi>Whatſoever things</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>are true, whatſoever things are honest; whatſoever things are just;</hi> think on theſe things.</p>
               <pb n="214" facs="tcp:63712:161"/>
               <p>You ſee I join theſe two words <hi>Honest</hi> and <hi>Just</hi> together, as importing the ſame thing. Though yet I am aware that the word we here render <hi>Honest</hi> is often uſed in another ſignification, that is to ſay, for <hi>Grave</hi> or <hi>Venerable:</hi> But ſince that other ſignification falls in moſt properly under my laſt Head, I wave it here, and take the word as our Tranſlation renders it.</p>
               <p>Indeed it is in vain to expect any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage from our profeſſion of the <hi>Truth,</hi> if we be not ſincerely <hi>Just</hi> and <hi>Honest</hi> in our Actions.</p>
               <p>Whoſoever can allow himſelf in the pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of any diſhoneſt, knaviſh indirect Dealing, let that Man be never ſo Orthodox in his Belief and Opinions; yet I am ſure he is no true Chriſtian.</p>
               <p>O therefore let me exhort you all, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Intereſts you have to ſerve; whatever Dealing; you are to engage in, to be always ſtrictly <hi>Just</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pright</hi> in your Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Uſe no Tricks, practiſe no ill Arts for the ſerving your ends, but in all your tranſactions with Men, deal with that Sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and Integrity and good Conſcience, that becomes thoſe who would be accounted the Diſciples of Him who was the moſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent, the moſt Sincere, and the leaſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigueing Perſon in the World.</p>
               <p>Aſſure your ſelves no diſhoneſty can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſper long. Whatever turns you may ſerve
<pb n="215" facs="tcp:63712:161"/>by it at preſent, yet you will bitterly repent of it ſometime or other. But Righteouſneſs and Juſtice doth eſtabliſh a Man's ways. And the upright Man, though he is not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the richeſt, yet always walketh moſt ſurely. And as for the final event of things; Remember this that God Almighty has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, that <hi>no <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteous</hi> men, <hi>no Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, no Lyars, no Extortioners, ſhall enter into the Kingdom of Heaven.</hi> But to go on.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The next thing I have to exhort you to from the words of my Text is the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of <hi>Purity.</hi> For after the Apoſtle hath recommended the purſuit of <hi>things</hi> that are <hi>true,</hi> and the things that are <hi>honest</hi> and <hi>just,</hi> he next adds the things that are <hi>pure.</hi> Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hereby that we ſhould ſtudy to be pure, and chaſt, and temperate both in our Hearts and Lives; avoiding all Exceſſes, and Lewdneſs, and Senſuality.</p>
               <p>And if he thought it convenient in that Age of ſtrictneſs and ſeverity and devotion, to put the Chriſtians in mind of this: I am ſure it is not only convenient but neceſſary to do it, in this Age of ours, when Luxury and Debauchery, when Whoredom and Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, and all ſorts of Vice; that are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to <hi>Purity,</hi> are grown to that height among us, that we ſeem to defie God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty by our impudent Practice of them, and provoke Him to give us up to Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</p>
               <pb n="216" facs="tcp:63712:162"/>
               <p>I pray God make the whole Nation deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſenſible of the Folly and Wickedneſs, as well as of the Danger and dreadful Couſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of theſe Practices. And as for you who are here preſent, let me beſpeak you in the Words of the Apoſtle; <hi>Dearly Beloved, I beſeech you as Strangers and Pilgrims, to ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtain from fleſhly Lusts, which war against the Soul.</hi> I beſeech you, as you have any Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour for your Lord and Maſter, as you have any regard to the preſervation of a ſenſe of Religion in your Minds, as you have any concern for your Health, for your Eſtates, for your Families; as you have any reſpect to the Publick, that Effeminacy and Sottiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Diſeaſes may not be entailed upon our Poſterity; Laſtly as you love your own Souls, and hope ever to ſee the face of God in Heaven, learn to live Soberly, learn to live Chaſtly, learn to practiſe Purity, and Temperance in all your Converſation. Avoid Whoredom and Drunkenneſs as you would the Plague, for certainly they are the worſt of Plagues to them that uſe them: For other Plagues do only put our Bodies in danger, but theſe do endanger both our Souls and Bodies. Nay, as to the one (I mean our Souls) they will prove certain inevitable Deſtruction without Repentance and Reformation.</p>
               <p>I know theſe things are made ſlight Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of by a great many among us. But aſſure your ſelves God will not account them
<pb n="217" facs="tcp:63712:162"/>ſo; it is certain he will not, if we may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve his Word; for it is there told us ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly, that <hi>Whoremongers and Adulterers God will judge.</hi> And withal, <hi>that neither Adulterers, nor Fornicators, nor unclean Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, nor Drunkards ſhall ever inherit the Kingdom of God, or of Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. I proceed to the laſt Head of Advice that is given in my Text. The Apoſtle ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving inſtanced in <hi>Three</hi> things neceſſary to be daily thought upon and purſued by all Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, <hi>viz. Truth,</hi> and <hi>Honeſty,</hi> and <hi>Purity,</hi> leaves off to meddle any farther with parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and ſums up the reſt of his Advice in generals. And that ſum comes to this, That as we are Chriſtians we ſhould not only take care of the three forementioned things, but ſhould make it our buſineſs to improve our ſelves in every other ſort of Virtue; nay in every other ſort of thing that is <hi>Praiſe-worthy,</hi> or that is well eſteemed of among Mankind. So that really it ſhould be the endeavour of our Lives, to render our ſelves as excellent and as exemplary for all ſorts of amiable Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities as it is poſſible for Men to be in this World.</p>
               <p>This I take to be the full meaning of thoſe <hi>four</hi> expreſſions that follow in my Text, <hi>Whatſoever things are lovely, whatſoever things are of good report; if there be any Vertue, if there be any Praiſe, think on theſe things.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="218" facs="tcp:63712:163"/>
               <p>And now, Brethren, ſee from hence what your obligations are. You that have ſuch a glorious Light vouchſafed you; ſuch unvaluable Promiſes, ſuch mighty Aſſiſtances made over to you by the Goſpel of Chriſt: You muſt in reaſon imagine that in return of theſe great Advantages, great things are expected from you.</p>
               <p>It will not ſatisfie your Engagements, that you do believe and profeſs the Goſpel, that you do no wrong to your Neighbours, that you are neither given to Lewdneſs nor Drunkenneſs, (though yet even theſe, as the World goes, are very great things, and could all Men that profeſs Chriſtianity truly ſay this of themſelves, we ſhould ſoon ſee Heaven upon Earth.) But your Chriſtianity obliges you to aſpire after greater things; you muſt get your ſelves poſſeſſed of the whole Circle of Virtues; you muſt be <hi>Kind</hi> and <hi>Charitable,</hi> as well as <hi>Just</hi> and <hi>Honest;</hi> you muſt be <hi>Modest</hi> and <hi>Meek,</hi> and <hi>Humble,</hi> as well as <hi>Temperate</hi> and <hi>Chast.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Nay, not only ſo, but you are to labour af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all theſe ſeveral Virtues in the full Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and Extent of them, even to that degree that every thing which hath but the <hi>appearance of Evil</hi> is to be avoided by you. You are not only to abſtain from Acts of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, but even from doing a <hi>hard</hi> thing to any one; you are not only to keep your ſelves within the known Limits of Tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance
<pb n="219" facs="tcp:63712:163"/>and Chaſtity, but to avoid all thoſe things that border upon the Vices oppoſite thereunto, and ſo as to all other inſtances; if any thing be of <hi>ill Report,</hi> and looks infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly to the ſober part of Mankind, why that very Conſideration is enough to deter you from the practice of it; For you are to recommend your Religion to all the Men in the World, by all the ways that are poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
               <p>In a Word, you are to endeavour to be as free from blame in your whole Converſation as you poſſibly can, and not only ſo, but to be as good, and to do as much good as your Circumſtances will allow you.</p>
               <p>This now is to be a Chriſtian indeed; by thus endeavouring you truly walk worthy of that high and heavenly Calling wherewith you are called, and you do (as the Apoſtle adviſes) <hi>adorn the Doctrine of God in all things;</hi> and happy, extreamly happy are they that do thus, for great is their Reward: Great even in this World, in the ſolid Peace and Aſſurance of God's Favour which they here enjoy, and which indeed far exceeds all the Bleſſings that the Earth can afford; but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly great in the Life to come, when Jeſus Chriſt ſhall come with all the Powers of Heaven to do Honour to thoſe that have thus here honoured him.</p>
               <p>Thus have I gone through all the Parts of my Text, but I do not think that I ought
<pb n="220" facs="tcp:63712:164"/>ſo to leave it. I have given you an account of the things that St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath here directed us to, to be the main purſuit of our Lives. But I think likewiſe it will be proper to ſpeak ſomething of the Methods of that purſuit, or the means which we are to obſerve, if we would practiſe this Text; and here I am to begin anew with my Advices. Several things I have to repreſent upon this Occaſion, and to exhort you to. I am not much ſolli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous, whether they ſtrictly belong to my Argument or no. But I deſire to leave them with you, as things that I judge to be very uſeful, and which I wiſh may be ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred by you.</p>
               <p>And the <hi>First</hi> thing I would exhort you to is this, <hi>That you would endeavour to poſſeſs your Minds with a hearty Senſe of God Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the abſolute Neceſſity of being ſeriouſly Religious.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I do not mention this, as if I thought there was any need to caution you againſt <hi>Atheiſm</hi> or <hi>Infidelity,</hi> for I hope not many among us are inclined that way. Mankind are naturally diſpoſed to believe a God and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and ſince through God's Bleſſing it is <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> that is the Religion of our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and in which we have been all Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: I look upon an <hi>Atheist</hi> or an <hi>Infidel</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, to be a ſort of <hi>Prodigy,</hi> a ſtrange unuſual Creature, vaſtly different from thoſe of his own Kind.</p>
               <pb n="221" facs="tcp:63712:164"/>
               <p>But here is the thing. Though moſt of us profeſs Religion, and the true Religion, yet many of us have no lively or hearty Senſe of it. We uſe Religion as we do our Cloaths. They are very convenient, nay perhaps neceſſary, and therefore we wear them, and for the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular form or mode of them, we follow, as to that, the Cuſtom of the Country where we live. Yet as the Cloaths we wear do not alter the Complexion or Features of our Body, ſo neither doth the Religion we Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs any more affect the Temper of our Souls. We ſerve our ſelves in both Caſes of the outward Conveniencies that are to be had by them, but we are ſtill the ſame Perſons both as to our outward and inward Linea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
               <p>But alas, this is a very ſorry way of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religious, and will do us no great kindneſs. We may perhaps reap ſome ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular advantages by it, but yet even the very trouble and pains it puts us to, do equal the Conveniencies we have from it. The Men that live thus, are juſt ſerved like thoſe that work in rich Mines. They are daily im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about Gold and Silver, or Gems, and they work hard, and they have their days wages for their Labour, but they are not a whit the richer for the Treaſures that come into their hands.</p>
               <p>Your Religion will never ſerve you to any extraordinary purpoſes, till your hearts be
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:63712:165"/>affected with it as well as your underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings. Let me therefore adviſe you, as you love either your Happineſs in this World, or in the next, make it your principal care to get a lively and vigorous Senſe of God im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed upon your Minds. And look upon it as the greateſt Intereſt you have to carry on, the greateſt Buſineſs you have to do in this World (as it really is) to approve your ſelves to this God by a ſincere endeavour in all your Converſation, to walk as his Son Jeſus Chriſt hath taught you. If you do this, you will certainly find the Sweet and Comfort of it both here and hereafter.</p>
               <p>When all is ſaid, it is a vain thing for any Man to expect a tolerable eaſie paſſage thro' this World, unleſs he have the Hopes of God's Favour to ſupport him under the Multitude of evil Accidents which the State of Humane Life will neceſſarily expoſe him to. And as for the other World, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out theſe Hopes he is perfectly loſt: And to be able to entertain any rational Hopes of God's Bleſſing and Favour, is a very vain thing likewiſe, unleſs we make it our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs with our whole Hearts and Souls to ſerve and pleaſe and obey Him.</p>
               <p>There are a great many Rules and Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>xims that we uſe to give to our Friends or our Children for the making their Fortunes, and I cannot deny but they are exceeding good ones. Thus for inſtance, we adviſe
<pb n="223" facs="tcp:63712:165"/>them to get a true underſtanding of their Buſineſs, and to purſue it diligently; to keep out of ill Company, to avoid Drinking or Gaming and Lewdneſs, and to ſtudy the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and Humours of Mankind, and to learn to apply themſelves dexterouſly to thoſe they have occaſion to converſe with; why theſe and ſuch others are excellent Rules, and moſt worthy of all Men to be ſtudied and practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. But ſtill there is one Rule above all theſe, and without which all the other will ſignifie very little to the making a Man's Life eaſie and comfortable; and that is to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a lively ſenſe of God upon our Spirits, to have his fear always before our Eyes, to love him above all things, to value his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour more than Life, and to dread his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure as the worſt of Evils. If we can but once get our Souls into this frame, we have done our Buſineſs both for this World and for Eternity; All the other particular Rules and Advices will be in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſuperfluous; for he that is poſſeſſed of this good Principle, will of courſe naturally fall into the practice of them. And beſides this Fear and Love of God in our Hearts, as it is the moſt effectual means, according to the uſual Diſpoſition of the Divine Providence, to put us into good Circumſtances of Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving; ſo it is the only means of making our Circumſtances happy to us, if they be good;
<pb n="224" facs="tcp:63712:166"/>or of making them eaſie and ſupportable, if they be bad.</p>
               <p>I do therefore moſt earneſtly recommend it to you, as you deſire that either you or yours may proſper, nay, as you would not be very miſerable; be not contented with a ſuperficial outſide Religion, but affect your minds as deeply as is poſſible with a ſenſe of God, and what you owe to him; and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to impreſs the ſame ſenſe upon your Friends and Children, and all that are about you. The truth of it is, ſo much doth our preſent happineſs, as well as our ſuture, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon this belief of God, and love to him, and hopes of his favour; that were it not for this, the preſent World with all the imaginary Pleaſures and Glories of it would appear to all wiſe and good Men, not only an empty dull unſatisfactory place, but a diſmal melancholy Priſon. If it was ſuppoſed that all things here were the effects of blind Chance, or fatal Neceſſity, and that there were no Wiſdom and Goodneſs that did preſide over the World, or took care of Mankind; no conſidering Man could deſire to live here.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Second</hi> thing I would leave with you, is this, That after you have got into your minds a hearty ſence of God and his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and his Preſence and Goodneſs; ſo as that you mean to make it the buſineſs of your lives to recommend your ſelves to
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:63712:166"/>him: you would in the next place, take care to keep up that ſence by a <hi>a conſtam and daily Worſhip of him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For God's ſake, and for your own Souls ſake, do not neglect your Prayers. You muſt never think that God will bleſs you, if you do not make a Conſcience of daily paying him your tribute of Honour and Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip.</p>
               <p>Be ſure therefore, you be conſtant in your private Devotions. As you every day receive the renewed pledges of God's Love and Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards you in a thouſand inſtances: So let every day your Affection and Gratitude be expreſſed to him, by hearty Prayer and Thankſgiving. This is abſolutely neceſſary to be done, as I have often told you, if you mean to preſerve any hearty ſenſe of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in your minds.</p>
               <p>But beſides this I have another thing to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to all thoſe that have Families. They are Heads and Governours of a <hi>Society.</hi> For indeed the firſt notion of <hi>Society</hi> is that of a <hi>Family.</hi> Every Family is a little King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and every Kingdom is or ought to be a great Family. Now is it natural, is it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, that there ſhould be any Society up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Earth wherein God ſhould not be own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and worſhipped? And yet woe be to us, how many thouſands of Families are there in this Kingdom, nay, I am afraid, even i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> about this City, wherein God is not ſo much
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:63712:167"/>as named in publick, unleſs perhaps by the way of affront, by the way of <hi>Curſing</hi> or <hi>Swearing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We deſervedly complain of the great Looſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Profaneneſs and Irreligion that hath overſpread the face of this Nation. O! I doubt a great deal of the blame of it lies up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Houſholders, the Maſters of Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies among us. If they would take better care of their Children and Servants, and let them know what it is to worſhip God, things would not be ſo bad among us. But how can we expect better, when there is no Religion either taught or practiſed in our Houſes. We give our Domeſticks opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities enough, of learning all our bad quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; but we give them none of learning our good ones, if we have any.</p>
               <p>They ſee us offending God by many raſh words and finful actions; but they do not ſee us repenting and asking God's Pardon by our ſolemn Prayers and Applications to the Throne of Grace. Let us therefore ſeriouſly lay this point to heart. I am ſure we have juſt cauſe to do it. Let us bring Religion into our Families, and not be contented that once a Week ſome of our People in their turns ſhould hear ſomething of it. Let us every day call our Family together, and pay our Common Tribute of Prayer and Praiſe for the Mercies we do daily receive in common.</p>
               <pb n="227" facs="tcp:63712:167"/>
               <p>Methinks our Saviour ſeemed to have a reſpect to this very Duty, and to charge it mightily upon us, when he made us that gracious promiſe, that even, <hi>where two or three were gathered together in his Name, there would he be in the midst of them.</hi> Sure, his words have moſt naturally a reſpect to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God that is performed in Families. As hath likewiſe the very contrivance of the Lord's Prayer: All the Petitions thereof be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo framed, as to be moſt proper to be ſaid by more than one, and yet too when we have ſhut our Doors for that purpoſe. But,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As you ought to take care about the Worſhip of God in your Cloſets and in your Families; let me add, that it equally concerns you to frequent the more publick Worſhip of God in his own Houſe. It is a bad ſign of ſome very ill principle or other, for any Man to be much a ſtranger there. Even to have the liberty and opportunity of worſhipping God in publick, is one of the greateſt Bleſſings and Privileges that we can have in this World; and hath by good Men always been ſo accounted. Now ſure, if we have this Notion of it, we ſhall think our ſelves mightily concerned to take all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities that come in our way, not only on Sundays, but on other days, of reſort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Publick Aſſemblies, and joining with them in the ſolemn Sacrifice of Prayer
<pb n="228" facs="tcp:63712:168"/>and Thankſgiving; and thinking it a good day to us, wherein we have thus employed our ſelves.</p>
               <p>The Sacrifices of this kind that we offer to God with an honeſt and devout mind, we cannot doubt will always find acceptance, and produce their effects; nay, perhaps when our Cloſet-prayers will not. For there are certainly more promiſes to <hi>publick</hi> Prayers than to <hi>private</hi> ones. Though yet both are very good, nay both are abſolutely neceſſary. But to proceed,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Being upon this Argument of the Means and Inſtruments of Religion, you may be ſure I cannot omit the mentioning of another thing, as one of thoſe points that I would moſt ſeriouſly recommend to you, and that is the ſolemn obſervation of the Lord's Day.</p>
               <p>I am not for laying ſtreſs upon the keeping of this day, or any other, more than the nature of the thing requires. I am ſenſible that the Doctrine about the obſervation of the Sabbath, as it is delivered by ſome Men, is ſuperſtitious enough, and oftentimes, where it is believed, proves rather a ſnare to Mens Conſciences, than of uſe to make them more Religious. Far therefore am I from deſiring you to be nice and ſcrupulous about the <hi>Punctilio</hi>'s of the Lord's-Day-ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. The Laws both of God and Men have in that matter left a great deal to your
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:63712:168"/>own diſcretion, and the circumſtances you are in. But however thus much is neceſſary, that every Man who profeſſeth himſelf a Chriſtian, ſhould bear a conſtant Religious regard to the Lord's Day, by devoting it to ſpiritual uſes, more eſpecially the publick Worſhip of God.</p>
               <p>I do not much doubt of the truth of the obſervation which ſome good Men have made, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Man ſhall proſper much better both in his Spiritual and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Affairs, all the Week after, for his careful obſervance of the Lord's Day. And I am likewiſe of opinion that thoſe Men have little or no ſenſe of Religion, that make no Conſcience of ſanctifying that Day, or that put no difference between it and other Days. Sure I am, were there nothing of a Divine Command for the ſetting a part this Day to Religious uſes (which yet I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is); yet it is one of the moſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and uſeful Conſtitutions that ever was made. So that even upon that account, all Men that have any Honour for God, or Zeal for the Publick Good, ſhould think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves obliged to obſerve it.</p>
               <p>The benefits of it are indeed unſpeakable. Not to mention the Civil or Temporal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences of it; in truth to the keeping up the Religion of this day we owe in a great meaſure that the very Face of Chriſtianity
<pb n="230" facs="tcp:63712:169"/>hath hitherto been preſerved among us. And were it not for this, for any thing I know, moſt of us in a very few years would become little better than Heathens and Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians. And ſo great an influence towards the making Men better, or at leaſt keeping them from growing worſe, hath this pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice always had; that you may obſerve the moſt profligate Men among us, who for their wickedneſs come to an untimely end, do generally impute their falling into thoſe ſins which cauſed their Death, to their breaking the Sabbath, as they commonly expreſs it. But,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> Let me upon this occaſion put you in mind of another thing, which by many of us is too much neglected. And that is, the taking all opportunities of coming to the holy Sacrament.</p>
               <p>I have often ſpoken to you abbout this matter, and I now deſire to remind you of it. There are little hopes you will ever make any great progreſs in Virtue and Holineſs, till you can bring your ſelves to a frequent and conſtant participation in this Holy My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery. Becauſe indeed this is the ſolemn Ordinance that Chriſt hath appointed for the conveying his Grace to us, and enabling us to overcome our ſins, and grow daily in Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue and Goodneſs,</p>
               <p>I know we have generally many and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veterate prejudices as to this matter. But
<pb n="231" facs="tcp:63712:169"/>aſſure your ſelves they are meer prejudices and no good reaſons. Every Man that means or deſigns honeſtly, and endeavours to lead his life as a Chriſtian ought to do, may certainly with as little ſcruple come every Month to the Communion, as he may come every Week to ſay his Prayers, or hear a Sermon. Nay, and I ſay further, if a Man do not ſo lead his life, that he may approach to the Sacrament every Month, nay every Week, nay every Day, if there be occaſion; I am afraid that he doth not live ſo, as to be fit for it, though he comes but once in a Year, or once in ſeven Years. For the dueneſs of your Preparation doth not depend upon your ſetting aſide ſo many extraordinary days for the forcing your ſelves into a Religious po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of mind, but upon the plain natural frame and temper of your Souls, as they conſtantly ſtand inclined to Virtue and Goodneſs. A Man that ſeriouſly endeavours to live honeſtly and religiouſly, may come to the Sacrament at an hour's warning, and be a Worthy Receiver. On the other ſide, a Man that lives a careleſs or a ſenſual Life, may ſet apart a whole Week or a whole Month for the exerciſing Repentance, and preparing himſelf for the Communion, and yet not be ſo worthy a Receiver as the other. And yet he may be a worthy Receiver too, provided he be really honeſt and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere in the matter he goes about; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="232" facs="tcp:63712:170"/>that he remember his Vows afterward, and do not ſink again into his former ſtate of careleſneſs and ſenſuality.</p>
               <p>But to return to my point. I do verily think that moſt of the doubts and fears and ſcruples that are commonly entertained a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us about receiving the Sacrament, are without ground or reaſon; and that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very well diſpoſed Perſon that hath no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther deſign in that action but to do his Duty to God, and to expreſs his belief and hopes in Jeſus Chriſt, and his thankfulneſs to God for him, may as ſafely at any time come to the Lord's Table, as he may come to Church to ſay his Prayers. And if the caſe be ſo (as I believe it is) then of what a mighty privilege and benefit do they deprive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, who when they have ſo many oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities, do ſo ſeldom join in that ſolemn In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of our Lord, which (as, I ſaid) was deſigned for no other purpoſe, but to be the means of our growing in Grace and Virtue, in Love to God and to all the Word?</p>
               <p>O therefore, my Brethren, let me beg of you not to be ſtrangers at the Lord's Table. But I need not beg it of you, for I am ſure you will not, whenſoever it ſhall pleaſe God to put it into your hearts ſeriouſly to mind the concernments of your Souls; and to be heartily ſenſible of the need you ſtand in of
<pb n="233" facs="tcp:63712:170"/>the Grace of Chriſt for the leading a holy and pure Life.</p>
               <p>I have but one thing more in the <hi>Sixth</hi> place, to leave with you, and I have done. It is not indeed of the nature of thoſe things I have laſt recommended to you, that is, a means or inſtrument of growing more Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous: But it is a principal Virtue it ſelf. And I do therefore recommend it to you, becauſe it is at all times uſeful, at all times ſeaſonable, but more eſpecially it ſeems to be ſo now: And that is, That you would walk in Love, and ſtudy Peace and Unity, and live in all dutiful ſubjection to thoſe whom God hath ſet over you, and endeavour in your publick ſtations to promote the publick Happineſs and Tranquillity as much as is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible: But by no means upon any pretence whatſoever to diſturb the publick Peace, or to be any way concerned with them that do; by no means ever to ingage in any Party o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> Faction, and leaſt of all any Faction in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which is grounded upon a State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point.</p>
               <p>I am ſorry the poſture of things among us gives me occaſion to mention this matter; but it is too viſible to what a height our ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſities and diſcontents are grown; and what the conſequences of them may be, unleſs there be a timely ſtop put to them, I tremble to think.</p>
               <pb n="234" facs="tcp:63712:171"/>
               <p>With Mens differences as to their notions about the Politicks I am not concerned; let Men frame what <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> they pleaſe about Government, though I do not like them, yet I do not think my ſelf bound to Preach againſt them. But when theſe differences are come to that paſs, that they threaten both the Civil and Eccleſiaſtical Peace; there I think no Miniſter ſhould be ſilent.</p>
               <p>Church-Diviſions God knows we have, and have always had too many, but it is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry grievous that thoſe who have always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared themſelves the Friends of our Church, and Enemies to Schiſm, ſhould at this time of Day ſet a helping hand to promote a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration.</p>
               <p>And yet it ſeems to this height are our differences come. Some People among us that formerly were very zealous for the Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed Worſhip of the Church, are now all of a ſudden ſo diſtaſted with it, that they make a ſcruple of being preſent at our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. Nay, ſome have proceeded ſo far as to declare, I know not upon what grounds, open War againſt us, and ſet up <hi>Separate</hi> Congregations in oppoſition to the <hi>Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>What is the meaning of this? Hath <hi>Schiſm</hi> and <hi>Separation</hi> from the eſtabliſhed Worſhip, which heretofore was branded as ſo heinous a ſin (and deſervedly too,) ſo changed its
<pb n="235" facs="tcp:63712:171"/>nature all of a ſudden, that it is become not only innocent but a Duty?</p>
               <p>Have we not the ſame Government both in Church and State that we formerly had? Have we not the ſame Articles and Doctrines of Religion publickly owned and profeſſed and taught, without the leaſt alteration? Have we not the ſame Liturgy, the ſame Offices and Prayers uſed every day that have always been? What is there then to ground a Separation upon?</p>
               <p>Yes, <hi>But the names in the Prayers are chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and we cannot Pray for thoſe that are now in Authority, as we could for thoſe that were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But how unreaſoanble is this, when St. <hi>Paul</hi> has bid us to put up <hi>Prayers and Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Interceſſions for all Men,</hi> eſpecially <hi>for Kings and all that are in Authority.</hi> Doth he make any reſtriction, any diſtinction what <hi>Kings,</hi> or what <hi>perſons in Authority</hi> we are to pray for, and what not? Doth he not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſly ſay, we muſt pray for <hi>all Men, and for all that are in Authority?</hi> And doth not the the reaſon of his exhortation imply as much, if his words did not? Namely, <hi>that we may lead quiet and peaceable Lives, in all Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Honeſty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But I pray conſider what this Doctrine leads to. If this Principle be admitted to be good Divinity, then farewell all the Obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to Eccleſiaſtical Communion among Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians.
<pb n="236" facs="tcp:63712:172"/>For what Government is there in the World that will not meet with ſuch Subjects as are not ſatisfied with it? And if that diſſatisfaction be a juſt reaſon to break Communion with the Eſtabliſhed Church, what Ligaments have we to tye Chriſtians together? What will become of <hi>holding the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity of the Spirit, in the Bond of Peace?</hi> What is the conſequence of this, but end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Schiſms and Separations?</p>
               <p>But further, I wiſh theſe Perſons would conſider what an unaccountable humour it is to make a Rent and Schiſm in the Church, upon a meer point of State.</p>
               <p>Great Revolutions have happened in all Ages and in all Countries, and we have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent inſtances of them in ſtory. But I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve it will not be eaſily found that ever any Chriſtians ſeparated from the Church upon account of them. Still they kept unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly to their Doctrine and their Worſhip, and never concerned themſelves farther in the Turns of State (how great ſoever they were) than peaceably to ſubmit to the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in being, and heartily to pray to God ſo to proſper their Government, and direct all their Affairs, that all their Subjects <hi>might lead quiet and peaceable lives under them in all Godlineſs and Honeſty.</hi> But when in a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution, a Prince was advanced to the Throne, that they looked upon to be a good Man, and an Encourager of the True
<pb n="237" facs="tcp:63712:172"/>Religion; in that caſe they did not only readily ſubmit to him, but acknowledged it as the great Bleſſing of God to them, that he had raiſed up ſuch a Man to rule over them. This was the Notion, and this was the Practice of the Primitive Chriſtians as to this matter, I may indeed ſay of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians in all Ages. And whatever you may have heard to the contrary, I doubt not to ſay that this is the very Doctrine of the Church of <hi>England.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let me therefore exhort all of you to be followers of Peace: to premote publick Unity and Concord as much as is poſſible; to ſtudy to be quiet, and mind your own bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; to be more concerned for your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and Nation than the Intereſt of any ſingle Man in it; heartily to ſubmit to the Government; and not only ſo, but to thank God for the Bleſſings you enjoy under it, and moſt earneſtly to pray for the Continuance of them: Laſtly, Never to eſpouſe any Party or Faction againſt the Government, nor ever to be driven away from the Communion of the Church, of which you have always pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed your ſelves Members, by any of the pretences which ſome warm Men may ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt to you. This I dare venture to ſay, how uneaſie ſoever ſome of you now may be in joining with our Prayers, you will at laſt be ten times more uneaſie in ſeparating from us. For Faction has no bounds, and
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:63712:173"/>God knows whither it will lead a Man at laſt. Were there nothing elſe but the Heat and Turbulency, the Paſſion and Peeviſhneſs, the bitter Zeal and Uncha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritableneſs that the being of a Party doth na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ingage Men in: I ſay, were there nothing elſe but this, No Man that conſults the peace of his own mind, would for any conſideration leave the publick Communion, and eſpouſe the cauſe of a ſeparate Intereſt. But there are worſe Conſequences than theſe, and I pray God we may never feel them.</p>
               <p>And now I have done with my Exhorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And I have ſpoke my thoughts very freely to you. And I hope you will receive what I have ſaid with the ſame kindneſs that I meant it. And truly I have no reaſon to doubt of it, after ſo long an experience as I have had of your Civility and Candor. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed during all the time I have been among you (which hath been now near ſixteen Years) I have been ſo kindly treated by you, and have received ſo many Teſtimonies of your Good-will, that I cannot but take this Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of publickly acknowledging my Obligations to you, and returning you my Solemn Thanks for Them.</p>
               <p>I cannot indeed ſay that I have done my Duty as I ought, and I heartily beg of God to forgive all my Defects. But I have this ſatisfaction, that I have ſincerely endeavou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red
<pb n="239" facs="tcp:63712:173"/>in all my Preaching, to inſtruct you in the true Doctrine of the Goſpel, and to teach you the right way that leads to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. And I am ſo certain, that I have not been miſtaken my ſelf, nor miſ-led you in that matter; that I dare with Confidence addreſs my ſelf to you in ſome of the words of the Apoſtle, which do immediately fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low after my Text: <hi>Viz. Thoſe things which you have learned and received and heard from me, do; and the God of Peace ſhall be with you.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall ever bleſs God for that Providence of his which placed me among you; and as I ſhall always and do earneſtly deſire all your Prayers for me; ſo I ſhall always heartily pray for you; that God would guide and proſper you, that his good Providence would always watch over you for good; that he would beſtow upon you and your Children after you all ſorts of Bleſſings needful and convenient for you; and eſpecially that he would deliver you from every evil work, and preſerve you to his Heavenly Kingdom. This God of his infinite Mercy grant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

               <p>THeſe are St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s words, and he ſpoke them of the <hi>Jews,</hi> thoſe unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving <hi>Jews</hi> that were ſo tenacious of the Traditions of their Fathers, and ſo ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly averſe to any Reformation of Religion: That though it appeared by undeniable evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that Chriſt Jeſus was by God ſent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:63712:175"/>to the World for that purpoſe; yet, did they to the laſt ſtand out in their oppoſition of him and his Goſpel, even to the final rejection of their Nation.</p>
               <p>To theſe People doth St. <hi>Paul</hi> in this Chapter expreſs a great Compaſſion, heartily wiſhing and praying for their Converſion. <hi>Brethren</hi> (ſaith he in the firſt verſe) <hi>my hearty deſire and prayer to God for Iſrael is, that they may be ſaved.</hi> That is, that they may come to the knowledge of the Truth in Chriſt Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus, and by that means obtain everlaſting Salvation. And one reaſon why he was thus concerned for them, he gives in the words following, which are the words I have read unto you. <hi>For I bear them Record</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that they have a zeal of God, but not according to knowledge.</hi> It was a great motive to him to be concerned for their happineſs, that they were Zealous, for <hi>Religion;</hi> though he knew at the ſame time, that the Religion they were then ſo Zealous of, was not the right Religion; nor did the Zeal they ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for it, proceed from right Principles.</p>
               <p>According to the account I have now gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of this Paſſage, Three things we may take notice of from it, <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. The Apoſtles approving and tacitly commending that <hi>Zeal</hi> which his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-men expreſſed for Religion.</item>
                  <pb n="243" facs="tcp:63712:175"/>
                  <item>II. His meek and charitable behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, even when their <hi>Zeal</hi> for Religion was very faulty and blameable.</item>
                  <item>III. His diſcovery of the faultineſs of their <hi>Zeal,</hi> which lay in this, <hi>that it was not according to knowledge.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Theſe <hi>Three</hi> things I ſhall take for the Heads of my following Diſcourſe upon this Text, and ſhall afterwards make ſuch Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of it, as the Buſineſs of this Day calls for.</p>
               <p n="1">I. <hi>First,</hi> I deſire it may be obſerved, That <hi>Zeal of God</hi> in general, that is, a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and paſſionate concernment for Religion, <hi>The Apoſtle here finds no fault with:</hi> On the contrary, he approves it as a commendable thing. For you ſee he repreſents it, as a piece of <hi>virtue</hi> in his Country-men, and ſpeaks it to their commendation, that they had a <hi>zeal of God, I bear them record</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>that they have a zeal of God.</hi> As much as to ſay, that he owned, they had that good quality, and they were to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for it; and for that reaſon he both wiſheth them well, and affectionately pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for them.</p>
               <p>That which I would from hence take occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to put you in mind of is this: That <hi>Indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nconcernedneſs</hi> for <hi>Religion</hi> is not to have a place among any ones Virtues and good Qualities; it is rather a very great fault;
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:63712:176"/>howſoever it may ſometimes paſs for an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of Wiſdom and Prudence.</p>
               <p>If indeed Men had no <hi>Paſſions,</hi> or had ſo mortified their Paſſions, that they were rare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly earneſt or zealous about any thing; their unconcernedneſs for Religion and the things of God might be the leſs reproveable. But when <hi>Zeal</hi> and <hi>Paſſion</hi> is more or leſs wrought into every Man's temper, and the calmeſt Men may be obſerved on ſundry oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions not to be without it; it is an inexcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſable fault to have no <hi>Paſſion,</hi> no <hi>Zeal</hi> for God and his Cauſe.</p>
               <p>How can a Man anſwer it to his own Conſcience, to be heartily angry when an affront in word or deed is done to himſelf; and yet to be altogether inſenſible, when God is affronted in his Prefence? To make a mighty buſtle, when his own <hi>Right</hi> and <hi>Property</hi> is at ſtake, though in never ſo ſmall a matter; and yet to ſhew no concernment for the <hi>Rights</hi> and the <hi>Honour</hi> of that God who made him, and by whoſe ſavour alone it is that he can call any thing his own that he hath.</p>
               <p>O! What a World of Good might we all do, if we had a true <hi>Zeal of God?</hi> How many Occaſions and Opportunities are there put into our Hands every Day (in what con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition or circumſtances ſoever we are) which if we were acted by this principle, would render us great Benefactors to Mankind, by
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:63712:176"/>diſcouraging Vice and Impiety, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting Virtue and Goodneſs in the World?</p>
               <p>But perhaps I have ſet this buſineſs of <hi>Zeal for God</hi> too high: Becauſe none are capable of being thus <hi>Zealous,</hi> but thoſe that have attained to a great degree of Virtue and Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which we cannot ſuppoſe of all, nor the moſt. But however, it will be a ſhame to all of us, if we do not come up to that pitch of <hi>Zeal</hi> which the unbelieving <hi>Jews</hi> are here commended for. <hi>I bear them record,</hi> ſaith St. <hi>Paul, that they have a zeal of God.</hi> What was this <hi>Zeal</hi> of theirs? Why, as I told you, (and as it plainly appears from the whole Chapter) it was an earneſt and paſſionate concernment for the <hi>Religion</hi> of their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Sure all Men among us both good and bad may come up to this degree of <hi>Zeal</hi> for <hi>God,</hi> and it is a reproach to us if we do not. Eſpecially confidering that their Religion at that time, was not <hi>God</hi>'s Religion, but Ours is.</p>
               <p>Indeed the Publick profeſſion of Religion in the right way, is as much every Man's <hi>Interest,</hi> and ought to be as much every Man's <hi>Care,</hi> as any the deareſt thing he hath in this World. Nay, to all Men that believe they have Souls to fave, it is more valuable than any other Worldly privilege. It concerns us all therefore to be Zealous in that matter. The Duty we owe to <hi>God,</hi> to our <hi>Country,</hi> and to <hi>our Selves,</hi> doth require it. In vain it is
<pb n="246" facs="tcp:63712:177"/>to be buſie about other things, and to neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect this. A Man will have but ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort when he comes to die, to reflect that he has been <hi>Zealous</hi> of the <hi>Privileges</hi> and <hi>Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> and <hi>Rights</hi> of his Country-men; but it was indifferent to him, how the <hi>Service</hi> of <hi>God</hi> and the Affairs of <hi>Religion</hi> were managed.</p>
               <p n="2">II. The <hi>Second</hi> thing we obſerve from this Paſſage, is, <hi>The Apoſtle's carriage to the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelieving Iſraelites, who though they were zealous for God, yet were in a great miſtake as to their Notions of the true Religion.</hi> He doth not bitterly cenſure them. He is not fierce nor furious againſt them. He doth not excite any perſon to uſe force or violence to them. But he rather pities them. He makes their <hi>Zeal</hi> that they had <hi>of God,</hi> an Induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the more heartily to pray for them, that God would direct them in the right way that leads to Salvation. Though he is far from approving their blind Zeal, in ſo obſtinately oppoſing the <hi>Righteouſneſs of God,</hi> that is, that Method which God had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed, for the attaining of Righteouſneſ, by the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt; and <hi>ſetting up a Righteouſneſs of their own,</hi> which conſiſted chiefly in obſerving the <hi>Ceremonials</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> his Law and the <hi>Traditions</hi> of their <hi>Fathers,</hi> as it follows in the next Verſe after my Text: Yet he thinks them the more pitiable and the more excuſable, in that this their Oppoſition
<pb n="247" facs="tcp:63712:177"/>proceeded from their <hi>Zeal of God,</hi> though it was a miſ-informed irregular Zeal.</p>
               <p>This practice and carriage of the Apoſtle towards theſe <hi>Ignorant Zealots,</hi> ought to be a Rule for us to walk by in the like Caſes. If Men be of a different <hi>way</hi> from us, as to <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion;</hi> if they hold other <hi>Opinions,</hi> or though they be of another <hi>Communion</hi> from us; and though too we are ſure they are mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtaken: Nay, and dangerouſly miſtaken too; yet if they have a <hi>Zeal of God,</hi> if they be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and ſincere in their way; if their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours in Religion be the pure reſults of a miſ-informed Conſcience: Let us, as the Apoſtle here did, take occaſion from hence to pity them, and to put up hearty Prayers to God for them; and to endeavour all we can by gentle methods, to reduce them to the right way: But by no means to expreſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt or hatred of them, or to treat them with Violence and Outrage. So far as their <hi>Zeal</hi> is for <hi>God,</hi> let us ſo far ſhew Tenderneſs and Compaſſion to them; and if their <hi>Zeal</hi> be in ſuch inſtances, as are really commend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, let us in ſuch inſtances not only bear with them, but propoſe them for our Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples. This, I ſay, was the Apoſtle's practice, and I think it is ſo agreeable to the <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Temper</hi> of our great Lord and Maſter <hi>Christ,</hi> that it will become us in like caſes to act accordingly.</p>
               <pb n="248" facs="tcp:63712:178"/>
               <p>But then after I have ſaid this, Theſe <hi>two</hi> things are always to be remembred.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That our Tenderneſs to miſtaken <hi>Zealots,</hi> muſt always be ſo managed, as that the true <hi>Religion,</hi> or the <hi>Publick Peace</hi> ſuffer no dammage thereby. And therefore how kindly and compaſſionately ſoever, we, as private Chriſtians, are to treat thoſe that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from us, and purſue a wrong way out of Conſcience: Yet this doth not hinder, but that both wholeſome <hi>Laws</hi> may be made for the reſtraining the exorbitances of miſtaken <hi>Zeal;</hi> and when thoſe <hi>Laws</hi> are made, that they may be put in execution.</p>
               <p>The Conſideration of <hi>Law-givers</hi> and <hi>Magiſtrates,</hi> is different from that of <hi>private</hi> Chriſtians. Their buſineſs is to ſee, <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid detrimenti reſpublica capiat,</hi> that the <hi>Government</hi> be ſecured, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>peace</hi> be kept, that the <hi>Laws</hi> of God be obſerved, that God's <hi>Religion</hi> as it is deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by <hi>Jeſus Christ</hi> be preſerved ſincere and undefiled, and that the ſolemn <hi>Worſhip</hi> of God be <hi>purely</hi> and <hi>decently</hi> performed. And therefore there is no doubt, but that in all theſe matters the Government may make Fences and Securities againſt the Inſults of intemperate <hi>Zealots,</hi> and when theſe Fences are made, it ſhould be at their Peril if they tranſgreſſed them, ſuppoſing Magiſtrates did their Duty. And all this we ſay is very conſiſtent with that Tenderneſs and Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="249" facs="tcp:63712:178"/>that all Chriſtians, and even Magiſtrates themſelves in their private Capacity, do owe to miſ-perſwaded erroneous Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciences.</p>
               <p>And then <hi>Secondly,</hi> it is to be remembred that that Kindneſs and Tenderneſs to miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Zealots, which we are ſpeaking of from the Text, is not to be expreſſed to all alike; but to ſome more, to ſome leſs, to ſome perhaps in no degree at all; according as the nature and quality of their Errors are, and according as the Men that are guilty of them, may more, or leſs, or not at all, be thought to have a real <hi>Zeal of God,</hi> and to act out of Principles of Conſcience. Thus for inſtance;</p>
               <p>In the Firſt place, Thoſe that ſet up for Patrons of <hi>Atheiſm</hi> or <hi>Epicuriſm;</hi> that make it their buſineſs in their Converſation to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe <hi>all</hi> Religion, and to bring it into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt; that ridicule the Profeſſors of it as a company of eaſie credulous Men; that make no Conſcience of blaſpheming God and all things Sacred, as occaſion is given them: Why, theſe Men may have <hi>Zeal</hi> enough for their Opinions, and we find that they often have a great deal too much: But are ſuch to be trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with that ſort of Tenderneſs and Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that we are now ſpeaking of? No, by no means; For they are quite out of the bounds of my Text, They <hi>have a Zeal</hi> indeed, but it is not a <hi>Zeal for God,</hi> but for the <hi>Devil</hi> and the
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:63712:179"/>Intereſts of his Kingdom. And if one were to meaſure the greatneſs of Crimes by the miſchief they do to humane Society; I ſhould think that this ſort of People were not to expect ſo much favour and reſpect from Mankind, as ſome other Malefactors that yet by our Laws are to pay for their offences at no leſs a rate than their Lives.</p>
               <p>Again, Secondly, If there be any Men that under a pretence of <hi>Religion</hi> do teach or encourage or promote any ſort of <hi>Vice</hi> or <hi>Immorality;</hi> or whoſe Principles do neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily lead to debauch Mens Manners in the plain matters of <hi>Sobriety, Chaſtity, Truth,</hi> or <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and the like; ſuch kind of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are by no means Objects of that Tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Compaſſion that we are now ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of: For the Laws of Nature as to moral <hi>Virtue</hi> and <hi>Vice</hi> are ſo plainly writ in every Man's heart, that he muſt be ſuppoſed to be an <hi>Ill</hi> Man that can eaſily entertain any Principle (let it come never ſo much recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended under the Name of Religion) that contradicts them. And whatever allowance may in charity be made for a Man's <hi>miſtakes,</hi> there is no reaſon that much ſhould be made for his <hi>Wickedneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Again, Thirdly, If there be any Men that whilſt they expreſs a great Zeal for the <hi>Puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> of Religion, and exclaim againſt the <hi>Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions</hi> of it (as they term them) which are introduced into the Publick Eſtabliſhment,
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:63712:179"/>and turn every ſtone to have all things ſetled in another Method; yet all this while God and their own Hearts know that all this Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment and <hi>Zeal</hi> of theirs for <hi>Religion,</hi> though it make a great ſhew, is only pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended; and that there is another thing that lies at the bottom, that is to ſay, Worldly <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest,</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> which they hope to compaſs by ſuch a Regulation of Matters as they deſire: I ſay, if there be any ſuch Men, they are likewiſe no way concerned in that Compaſſion my Text ſpeaks of. For though they may be very <hi>Zealous,</hi> yet it is a <hi>Zeal</hi> for their own ſecular <hi>advantages</hi> that acts them, and not a <hi>Zeal of God.</hi> If ſuch Men could be known; inſtead of being kindly and charitably thought of for their Zeal in Religion; the Virtuous part of Mankind would look upon them as the worſt of Hypocrites. But ſince God only knows the Hearts of Men; all ſuch pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenders to <hi>Zeal</hi> for <hi>Religion,</hi> muſt, till we know them alſo, be treated according to the Merits of the cauſe they pretend to be Zealous for.</p>
               <p>But then Fourthly and Laſtly, All that I have now ſaid is with reſpect to thoſe that are out of the limits of my Text, ſuch as have no <hi>Zeal of God,</hi> though ſome of them may pretend it: But then, as for thoſe that really act out of Principles of Conſcience, and have a real <hi>Zeal of God,</hi> though in a
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:63712:180"/>wrong way; Theſe are true Objects of our Tenderneſs and Compaſſion, though yet in different degrees. For according as their <hi>Principles</hi> and <hi>Practices</hi> do more or leſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure our common <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> or are more or leſs dangerous to our <hi>Government</hi> and <hi>Conſtitution;</hi> in the ſame proportion, the greater or leſs Tenderneſs and Indulgence is to be expreſſed towards them. But moſt of what concerns this matter being already ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by Law, I will not be ſo bold as to med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle in it, and therefore I proceed to the <hi>Third</hi> Head of my Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p n="3">III. The <hi>Third</hi> thing I told you we might obſerve from this Text was this, <hi>The Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle's tacit Reprehenſion of the Jewiſh</hi> Zeal <hi>up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this account, that it was not according to Knowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Uſe I make of this is, that from hence we may be able to gather to our ſelves a true Rule for the governing our <hi>Zeal</hi> in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion, and likewiſe for the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in others what <hi>Zeal</hi> is commendable, and what is not.</p>
               <p>For be our <hi>Zeal of God</hi> never ſo great, yet if it be not <hi>a zeal according to knowledge,</hi> it is not the right Chriſtian <hi>Zeal.</hi> And though we ſee others never ſo fervent and vehement in purſuing a Religious Cauſe, and that too out of Conſcience; yet if this <hi>Zeal</hi> of theirs be not <hi>according to knowledge,</hi> it is a Zeal
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:63712:180"/>that juſtly deſerves to be reproved. And though both we and they may for our ſince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity in Gods Cauſe, expect ſome Allowances, both from God and Man, yet neither they nor we can juſtifie it, either to God or Man, that we are thus fooliſhly and ignorantly Zealous.</p>
               <p>I wiſh this mark of right <hi>Zeal,</hi> that it ought to be <hi>according to knowledge,</hi> were more conſidered. For it ſeems not often to be thought on by thoſe that are moſt <hi>zealous</hi> in their way, of what perſwaſion ſoever they be. This ſame buſineſs of <hi>Knowledge,</hi> is a thing that is moſt commonly forgot to be taken in as an ingredient or Companion of <hi>Zeal,</hi> in moſt ſort of Profeſſors. For as the World goes, thoſe Men are generally found to be the greateſt <hi>Zealots,</hi> who are moſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly <hi>Ignorant.</hi> Whereas true Zeal ſhould not only proceed from true Knowledge, but ſhould alſo be always accompanied with it, and governed by it.</p>
               <p>But what is it to <hi>have a Zeal according to Knowledge?</hi> What doth this Character of juſtifiable right Zeal contain in it? I anſwer, it muſt at leaſt contain in it theſe <hi>five</hi> follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing things.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> To <hi>have a Zeal according to Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge,</hi> doth import, that we be not miſtaken, as to the <hi>matter</hi> of our <hi>Zeal;</hi> that it be a <hi>good Cauſe,</hi> that we are <hi>zealous</hi> about. And ſince it is <hi>Zeal for God</hi> that we are here ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="254" facs="tcp:63712:181"/>of, it muſt be ſomething wherein our <hi>Duty</hi> is concerned, that muſt be the object of our <hi>Zeal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that a right <hi>Zeal of God</hi> implies, that we do ſo well inform our ſelves of the Nature of our Religion, as not to pretend a Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Zeal for any thing that is not a part of our Religion. If our <hi>Zeal for God</hi> be as it ſhould be, it muſt certainly expreſs it ſelf in matters that are <hi>good;</hi> about ſuch objects as God hath made to be our <hi>Duty. It is good</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>to be always zealouſly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected in a good matter.</hi> But if we miſtake in our <hi>Cauſe,</hi> if we take that for <hi>good</hi> which is <hi>evil,</hi> or that for <hi>evil</hi> which is <hi>good,</hi> here our Zeal is not <hi>according to Knowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> as the <hi>object</hi> of our <hi>Zeal</hi> muſt be <hi>according to Knowledge,</hi> ſo alſo the <hi>Principle</hi> from whence our <hi>Zeal</hi> proceeds, muſt be <hi>according to Knowledge</hi> alſo. That is to ſay, We muſt have ſolid and rational grounds to proceed upon in our concernment for any thing; ſuch as will not only ſatisfie our ſelves, but all others that are unbyaſſed: In a word, ſuch as we can juſtifie to all the World.</p>
               <p>If it be every Man's Duty (as St. <hi>Peter</hi> tells us it is) <hi>to be ready to give an Anſwer to every one that asketh him a reaſon of the Hope that is in him:</hi> Then I am ſure, it is much more every Man's Duty to be able to give a reaſon of the <hi>Zeal</hi> that is in him. Becauſe
<pb n="255" facs="tcp:63712:181"/>this buſineſs of a Man's <hi>Zeal</hi> doth more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the Publick, and is of greater Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to it, than what a Man's private <hi>Faith</hi> or <hi>Hope</hi> is.</p>
               <p>But yet how little is this conſidered by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>zealous</hi> Men among us? Some are <hi>zealous</hi> for a point to ſerve an <hi>Interest</hi> or a <hi>Faction.</hi> But this is not to be owned as the ground and reaſon of <hi>Zeal;</hi> for indeed if it ſhould, it would not be allowed of. Others are <hi>zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> for no other reaſon but becauſe they find their <hi>Teachers,</hi> or thoſe they moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with, are ſo. They follow the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon <hi>Cry,</hi> and examine no more of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Others indeed have a Principle of <hi>Zeal</hi> beyond all this. For they are <hi>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ved</hi> from within, to ſtand up for this or the other Cauſe; they have <hi>Impulſes</hi> upon their minds which they cannot reſiſt: But that in truth is no more a juſtifiable ground of any Man's <hi>Zeal,</hi> than either of the former. For if theſe <hi>Motions</hi> and <hi>Impulſes</hi> that they ſpeak of be from God; there will certainly be conveyed along with them, ſuch <hi>Reaſons</hi> and <hi>Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments</hi> for the thing that they are to be <hi>zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous</hi> about, as will, if they be declared, ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie and convince all other reaſonable Men, as well as themſelves. For it is a ridiculous thing to imagine, that God at this day doth <hi>move</hi> or <hi>impel</hi> Men in any other way than what is agreeable to the Reaſon of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and the Rule of his holy Word. And
<pb n="256" facs="tcp:63712:182"/>if the Man's <hi>Zeal</hi> can be juſtified by either of theſe, there is no need of vouching <hi>Inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations</hi> for it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> As the <hi>Zeal</hi> which is according to knowledge hath a good <hi>matter</hi> for its <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject,</hi> and proceeds from a right <hi>Principle:</hi> So it is alſo <hi>regular</hi> as to the <hi>Meaſures</hi> of it. He that hath it is careful that it do not exceed its due Bounds, as the <hi>Ignorant Zeal</hi> often doth; but he diſtinguiſheth between the ſeveral objects he is <hi>zealous</hi> for, and allows every one of them, juſt ſo great a Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as the thing is worth, and no more. If the thing be but a <hi>ſmall matter,</hi> he is but in a <hi>ſmall meaſure</hi> concerned for it. If it be of greater moment, he believes he may be allowed to be the more earneſt about it. But he looks upon it as a raſh and fooliſh thing, and an effect of great ignorance or weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to be hot and eager for all things alike. We ſhould account him not many degrees removed from a <hi>Child</hi> or an <hi>Ideot,</hi> that upon the cut of a Finger ſhould as paſſionately complain and cry out for help, as if he had broken a Limb. Why juſt the ſame Folly and Childiſhneſs it is, to make a mighty buſtle about ſmall matters which are of no conſequence, in which neither <hi>Religion</hi> nor the <hi>Publick Peace,</hi> are much concerned; as if indeed our Lives and Souls were in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. It therefore becomes all prudent and ſober Men to take care, that their <hi>Zeal</hi> do not
<pb n="257" facs="tcp:63712:182"/>ſpend it ſelf in <hi>little</hi> things; that they be not too paſſionate and earneſt, and vehement for things that are not worth much contending for. If we lay a greater weight upon a Cauſe than it will bear, and ſhew as much warmth and paſſion for ſmall matters, as if the <hi>Fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentals</hi> of our <hi>Faith</hi> were at ſtake, we are <hi>zealous</hi> indeed, but not <hi>according to Knowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The <hi>Zeal</hi> that is <hi>according to knowledge,</hi> is always attended with hearty <hi>Charity.</hi> It is not that <hi>bitter Zeal</hi> which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, which is accompanied with <hi>Hatred</hi> and <hi>Envy,</hi> and <hi>perverſe Diſpu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings:</hi> But it is kind, and ſociable, and meek, even to Gainſayers. It is that <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom which is from above, that is first pure, then peaceable, gentle and eaſie to be intreated.</hi> It is a Zeal that loves <hi>God</hi> and his <hi>Truth</hi> hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily, and would do all that is poſſible to bring Honour and Advancement to them: But at the ſame time it loveth all <hi>Men.</hi> And therefore in all things where it expreſſes it ſelf, it purely conſults the <hi>Merits</hi> of the <hi>Cauſe</hi> before it, but lets the <hi>Perſons</hi> of Men alone. It is a certain Argument of an <hi>Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant</hi> and ungoverned <hi>Zeal,</hi> when a Man leaves his Cauſe and his Concernment for God's Glory, and turns his Heat upon thoſe that he has to deal with; when he is peeviſh and angry with Men that differ from him: When he is not contented to oppoſe
<pb n="258" facs="tcp:63712:183"/>Arguments to Arguments, and to endeavour to gain his point by calm Reaſoning; but he flies out into Rage and Fury; and when he is once tranſported herewith, he cares not what undecent bitter Reflections he makes upon all thoſe that have the Fortune to be of a different ſide. But in theſe Caſes Men would do well to remember, that the <hi>Wrath of Man worketh not the Righteouſneſs of God,</hi> as the Apoſtle expreſſes it. All this kind of behaviour favours of the Wiſdom of this World, which is <hi>Earthly, and Senſual, and Deviliſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fifthly,</hi> and laſtly, Another inſeparable Property of <hi>Zeal according to Knowledge</hi> is, That it muſt purſue lawful <hi>Ends</hi> by lawful <hi>Means;</hi> muſt never do an <hi>Ill</hi> thing for the carrying the <hi>best Cauſe.</hi> This St. <hi>Paul</hi> hath laid down, as a Rule, to be eternally obſerved among Chriſtians, when in the <hi>third</hi> of the <hi>Romans,</hi> he declares, that <hi>their damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is just, who ſay, Let us do evil that good may come,</hi> Be therefore our Point never ſo good or never ſo weighty, yet if we uſe any diſhoneſt, unlawful Arts, for the gaining of it; that is to ſay, If we do any thing which is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in it ſelf Evil, and appears to be ſo by the natural Notices of Mankind, or which the Laws of our Holy Religion do forbid: I ſay in all ſuch Inſtances we are Tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors. And though our <hi>Cauſe</hi> be very good and our <hi>Ends</hi> very allowable; yet ſince the
<pb n="259" facs="tcp:63712:183"/>
                  <hi>Means</hi> by which we would accompliſh thoſe <hi>Ends</hi> are unwarrantable, the whole <hi>Action,</hi> though proceeding from never ſo much <hi>Zeal for God,</hi> is very <hi>Bad,</hi> For true <hi>Zeal</hi> as it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſuppoſeth a right Information of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to the matter of it, ſo likewiſe it ſuppoſeth, that a Man ſhould act in honeſt ways, and endeavour to attain his ends by lawful means.</p>
               <p>And thus have I laid before you the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties and Characters of that <hi>Zeal</hi> which is <hi>according to knowledge,</hi> which was the third and laſt thing I propoſed upon this Text; and I pray God we may always remember them whenever we have occaſion to expreſs a Zeal for any thing, eſpecially in matters of Religion. All that remains now is, to make ſome brief Application of my Text, with reference to the buſineſs of the Day.</p>
               <p>Theſe words, as I told you, were ſpoke of the Jews. But the Character here given of them doth ſo well fit a ſort of Men, whoſe fiery <hi>Zeal</hi> for <hi>God</hi> and their <hi>Religion,</hi> gave occaſion to the Solemnity of this Day; that it looks as if it were made for them. It is the <hi>Bigots</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> that I mean; to whom we muſt do the ſame right that St. <hi>Paul</hi> here did his Countrymen, We muſt <hi>bear them Record, that they have a Zeal of God, but not according to Knowledge.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="260" facs="tcp:63712:184"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Zealous</hi> they are ſufficiently, as the Jews were, no body doubts of it. But as for their <hi>Zeals being according to knowledge,</hi> there is great reaſon to doubt, they are as faulty in that point, as St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Countrymen were. Indeed if you were to draw the compariſon between the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> and <hi>Popiſh Zealots,</hi> as to all the ſeveral particulars that our <hi>Saviour</hi> and St. <hi>Paul</hi> take notice of as Inſtances of <hi>blind Zeal</hi> in the former: You would find in all thoſe particulars both their <hi>Zeals</hi> to be much of a piece, not only as to the <hi>Fervour,</hi> but as the <hi>Blindneſs</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>Was it an inſtance of <hi>Ignorant Zeal</hi> in the <hi>Jews</hi> that they ſet up their <hi>Traditions</hi> to the diſparagement of the <hi>Law of God?</hi> I pray, who are thoſe that diſparage the Holy <hi>Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures,</hi> by ſetting their <hi>Traditions</hi> upon an equal foot with them?</p>
               <p>Were the Jews to be blamed for that they were ſo zealous for their old Religion, as to oppoſe that <hi>Reformation</hi> of it, which our Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> endeavoured to introduce among them, becauſe they thought it was an <hi>Inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi> I pray who are thoſe, who upon that very ground oppoſe all <hi>Reformation</hi> at this Day, though yet the wiſeſt and beſt Men among themſelves are ſufficiently ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, that there are great Corruptions, both in their <hi>Doctrine</hi> and <hi>Worſhip?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Was it a fault in the Jewiſh Zeal that it placed Religion too much in <hi>Ceremonies</hi> and <hi>For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities,</hi>
                  <pb n="261" facs="tcp:63712:184"/>in <hi>waſhing Cups and Platters, in ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Mint and Cummin,</hi> and the like to the neglect of the weightier matters of the Law, <hi>Juſtice, and Mercy, and Faith?</hi> I pray, wherein is <hi>Image-worſhip, Invocation of Saints, Penances, Pilgrimages,</hi> the uſe of <hi>Reliques, Holy Water,</hi> &amp;c. I ſay wherein are theſe things better than thoſe? And yet we know who they are that lay ſo great a ſtreſs upon theſe and ſuch other things, that it may be truly ſaid, a great part of their Religion is made up of them.</p>
               <p>It would not be difficult to run the paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel between the <hi>Zeals</hi> of the two <hi>Religions,</hi> through ſeveral more Inſtances; But it is an unpleaſant Argument, and therefore I will purſue it no farther.</p>
               <p>Only one inſtance more of the Jewiſh <hi>Zeal</hi> I muſt not paſs by, becauſe it comes up ſo fully to the buſineſs of this Day.</p>
               <p>So <hi>zealous</hi> were they for their <hi>Religion,</hi> that they did not care what ſort of means they made uſe of for the promoting of it, were they never ſo wicked and unnatural. Our <hi>Saviour</hi> they <hi>hunted</hi> to Death with <hi>falſe Witneſſes; Stephen</hi> they ſtoned out of <hi>pure zeal</hi> in a popular tumult. <hi>Forty</hi> of them ſolemnly bound themſelves under a <hi>Curſe,</hi> that they would neither eat nor drink till they had killed St. <hi>Paul.</hi> But all this, and a great deal more our Saviour had foretold they would do, when he told his Apoſtles, that
<pb n="262" facs="tcp:63712:185"/>
                  <hi>the time would come, when whoſoever killed them ſhould think that he did God good ſervice.</hi> A Bleſſed way of doing God ſervice this is, to act ſuch wicked inhumane things as theſe! But ſuch inhumane things as theſe doth a <hi>Blind Zeal</hi> for Religion ſometimes put Men upon. And that it doth ſo, we cannot have a greater proof (except what I have already mentioned) than the practices of the zealous Men of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How many unlawful Arts have they uſed to ſubject all the Chriſtian World to their Lord and Maſter? How many <hi>Forgeries</hi> for this purpoſe have they been the Authors of, and maintained them afterwards? How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſturbances have they given to the Peace of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> in the moſt unjuſt and unnatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ways for the Advancement of the <hi>Papal</hi> Cauſe? It was out of <hi>Zeal</hi> for Gods Service and the Intereſt of Holy Church, that ſo many Princes have been Excommunicated and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; that ſo many Tumults and Rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons have been raiſed; that ſo many <hi>Cruſados,</hi> for the extirpating <hi>Hereticks,</hi> have been ſent out. By which, and ſuch like means, it may juſtly be computed, that as much <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian</hi> Blood has been ſhed for the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Popery,</hi> as it now ſtands, nay, and a great deal more, than ever was during all the times of the <hi>Heathen</hi> Perſecutions for the ſupporting of <hi>Paganiſm,</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="263" facs="tcp:63712:185"/>
               <p>But if there were no other inſtance extant in the World to ſhew what is to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from a <hi>blind Zeal,</hi> eſpecially a <hi>blind Popiſh Zeal</hi> for Religion, that inſtance which the deliverance of this Day doth give us occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to mention, would be alone ſufficient to inform us. When for no other end, but for the Advancement of <hi>Popery,</hi> and the rooting out that Peſtilent <hi>Hereſie</hi> of the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation,</hi> which infeſted theſe Northern Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, a Company of Popiſh <hi>Zealots</hi> entered upon the moſt Barbarous and Inhumane Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that ever was undertaken by Men; even neither better nor worſe, than the deſtroying the <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Parliament</hi> at one blow; and had put all things in ſuch a readineſs in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thereunto, that they certainly had ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected it, as on this Day, had not their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiracy been detected in a wonderful manner.</p>
               <p>But thanks be to God, their deſigns then and ever ſince, have been defeated, and ſome of them even miraculouſly; and we truſt in the Mercies of God that they will ever be ſo.</p>
               <p>God hath been wonderfully Gracious to us in the Preſervation of our <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> from <hi>Popiſh</hi> attempts to deſtroy it, ever ſince it was ſetled among us.</p>
               <p>How many Plots and Conſpiracies were laid in the time of the Glorious Q. <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> to put an end to her Life, and with it, to our reformed eſtabliſhment?</p>
               <pb n="264" facs="tcp:63712:186"/>
               <p>What a dreadful one was this of the <hi>Gun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powder Treaſon,</hi> in the Reign of her Succeſſor?</p>
               <p>How many Dangers have threatned us ſince that time from that quarter?</p>
               <p>What a horrible ſtorm but of late did we apprehend, and juſtly enough too, was impending over us?</p>
               <p>And yet bleſſed be God (who hath never ſailed to raiſe up Deliverers to his People in the day of their Diſtreſs) that ſtorm is blown over. And we are here not only in Peace and Quietneſs, in the full poſſeſſion of our Native <hi>Rights</hi> and <hi>Liberties,</hi> and in the Enjoyment of the Free Exerciſe of our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi> (which is one of the moſt deſirable things in the World). But ſuch is the delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance that God hath wrought for us, that we alſo ſeem to have a fair proſpect of the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of theſe Bleſſings among us; and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Humane Eſtimate, to be in a good meaſure out of the danger of our old Invete<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Enemy, <hi>Popery</hi> I mean, which one would think had now made its laſt effort among us.</p>
               <p>Is not this now a great Bleſſing? And muſt not all ſincere Proteſtants (of what perſwaſions ſoever they be in other reſpects) neceſſarily believe ſo? Certainly they muſt, if they think it a Bleſſing to be <hi>delivered out of the hands of our Enemies,</hi> and to be in a Condition <hi>to ſerve God without fear.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us all therefore own it as ſuch to God Almighty; let us thankfully remember all
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:63712:186"/>his paſt Deliverances from <hi>Popery,</hi> and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, let us never forget thoſe of this Day; neither the <hi>former,</hi> nor this <hi>late</hi> one.</p>
               <p>We have reaſon to believe, that God hath a tender Care of his <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Religion</hi> in theſe Kingdoms, not only becauſe he hath ſo many times ſo ſignally and wonderfully appeared for the preſervation it: But more eſpecially, becauſe we know, and are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, that our Religion is according to his Mind and Will; being no other than that which his Son Jeſus Chriſt taught unto the World; that is to ſay, no other than that which is in the <hi>Bible,</hi> which is our only <hi>Rule</hi> of <hi>Faith.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It infinitely concerns us all therefore ſo to behave our ſelves, as to ſhew, that we are neither <hi>unthankful</hi> for Gods paſt Mercies, nor <hi>unqualified</hi> for his future Protection.</p>
               <p>And in order to that, I know no other way but this, that we all firmly adhere to to the <hi>Principles</hi> of our <hi>Religion;</hi> and that in our <hi>Practices</hi> we conform our ſelves to thoſe Principles. That is to ſay,</p>
               <p>In the firſt place, That we ſincerely love and fear God, and have a hearty ſenſe of his Preſence, and Goodneſs, and Providence, continually abiding in our Minds. That we truſt in him, depend upon him, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge him in all our ways: That we be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful of his Worſhip and Service, paying him the conſtant Tribute of our Prayers, and
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:63712:187"/>Praiſes and Thankſgiving, both in Publick and Private.</p>
               <p>And then ſecondly, that we be pure and unblameable in our Lives; avoiding the <hi>Pollutions that are in the World through Lust;</hi> and exerciſing Chaſtity, and Modeſty, Meekneſs and Humility, Temperance and Sobriety, amidſt the ſundry Temptations we have to conflict with.</p>
               <p>And thirdly, that we have always a fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent Charity to one another, <hi>that we Love as Brethren;</hi> endeavouring to do all the good we can, but doing harm to none. Uſing Truth and Juſtice, and a good Conſcience in all our dealings with Mankind. <hi>Living peaceably, if it be poſſible, with all Men.</hi> And not only ſo, but in our ſeveral Places and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, promoting Peace, and Unity and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord among Chriſtians, and contributing what we can to the healing the ſad Breaches and Diviſions of our Nation.</p>
               <p>And then laſtly, that we pay all Submiſſion and Duty and Obedience to the King and Queen whom God hath ſet over us; endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring in all the ways that are in our Power, to render their Government both as <hi>eaſie</hi> to themſelves, and as <hi>acceptable</hi> to their Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and as <hi>formidable</hi> to their Enemies as is poſſible.</p>
               <p>If all of us that call our ſelves <hi>Proteſtants</hi> would charge our ſelves with the Practice of theſe things, how aſſured might we re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1+ letters">

               </list>
               <p n="1">I. I begin with the firſt, The <hi>Appearance of our Lord</hi> in general. <hi>Now hath he appeared,</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us here conſider, <hi>first, Who</hi> it was that appeared: And then, <hi>How</hi> he did ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Perſon</hi> appearing we will conſider both as to his <hi>Nature,</hi> and as to his <hi>Office.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He that appeared, as to his <hi>Nature</hi> was <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man;</hi> both theſe <hi>Natures</hi> were uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in him and made one <hi>Perſon.</hi> He was
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:63712:189"/>
                  <hi>God with us.</hi> So the Angel ſtiles him in the <hi>first</hi> of St. <hi>Matthew.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was <hi>the Word that was with God, and was God, and by whom all things were made.</hi> He was, I ſay, that, <hi>Word</hi> made <hi>Fleſh</hi> and <hi>dwelling among us.</hi> So St. <hi>John</hi> ſtiles him in the <hi>first</hi> of his Goſpel.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> He was <hi>God manifest in the Fleſh,</hi> ſo St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſtiles him in the <hi>first</hi> Epiſtle to <hi>Timothy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This was the <hi>Perſon</hi> that the Text ſaith, <hi>Now appeared,</hi> that is, the Son of God in Humane Nature. <hi>God</hi> of the ſubſtance of his Father begotten before all Worlds, and <hi>Man</hi> of the ſubſtance of his Mother born in the World. Perfect <hi>God,</hi> and Perfect <hi>Man</hi> and yet but one <hi>Perſon.</hi> For as the Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able <hi>Soul</hi> and the <hi>Body</hi> make one <hi>Man;</hi> ſo here <hi>God</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> make one <hi>Christ.</hi> As our Creed expreſſes it.</p>
               <p>And this leads me to his <hi>Office.</hi> This Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine <hi>Perſon</hi> God-Man, that the Text here ſaith <hi>appeared,</hi> was, by his Office, the <hi>Christ,</hi> the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> that is, that great Miniſter of God, that Anointed <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Priest</hi> and <hi>Prophet,</hi> which from the beginning of the World he promiſed to ſend down upon Earth for the ſalvation of Mankind. Who was believed in by the Patriarchs; Typified by the Law; Foretold by all the Prophets; Shadowed out in all the Oeconomy of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Nation; Expected by all the <hi>Iſrae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites;</hi>
                  <pb n="372" facs="tcp:63712:190"/>And wiſhed for by the beſt of the Heathen World.</p>
               <p>This <hi>Perſon</hi> inveſted with this <hi>Office</hi> at laſt <hi>appeared;</hi> and in what manner, you all know from his Story in the Goſpel.</p>
               <p>He was by the Holy Spirit of God con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in the Womb of a Virgin, as was foretold of him by the Prophets; of which an Angel of the higheſt order in Heaven firſt brought the happy Tidings to the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin her ſelf.</p>
               <p>This Virgin, by as ſtrange a Providence, when the time of her Delivery drew near, was brought from her own City and Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in <hi>Galilee,</hi> to <hi>Bethlehem</hi> a City of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah,</hi> where ſhe brought forth this Illuſtrious Babe; And thereby fulfilled another Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy concerning him, namely, That he ſhould be born in <hi>Bethlehem,</hi> which alſo the <hi>Scribes</hi> at that time acknowledged.</p>
               <p>The circumſtances indeed of his Birth were far from any outward Pomp and Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence. The Virgin his Mother was poor and a ſtranger; and ſo ill befriended, that in the Confluence of People with which the City was then crowded, ſhe was able to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure no better a lodging than the <hi>Stable</hi> of an <hi>Inn:</hi> So that a <hi>Manger</hi> was the place that firſt received the Lord of Glory. This Slur, this Affront God then thought fit to put upon all that external Splendour and Grandeur, which
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:63712:190"/>uſually doth ſo much dazle the Eyes of Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Men.</p>
               <p>But God failed not to make abundant amends for the meanneſs of his <hi>Birth,</hi> by giving ſundry other demonſtrable Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of the Dignity of the <hi>Perſon</hi> that was then born.</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Magi</hi> from the Eaſt (<hi>Princes</hi> ſhall I call them, or <hi>Philoſophers?</hi>) being condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted by a new Star, came and pay'd their Homage, and brought their Offerings to this King of the World in a <hi>Manger.</hi> And the Shepherds, that were watching their Flocks in the Fields by night, were ſurprized with the Glory of the Lord ſhining round about them, and an Angel that thus ſpoke to them; <hi>Fear not, for behold I bring you Tidings of great Joy which ſhall be to all People, for unto you is born this day in the City of David, a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour which is Christ the Lord. And this ſhall be a ſign unto you, ye ſhall find the Babe wrapped in ſwadling Cloths lying in a Manger. And ſuddenly there was with the Angel a Multitude of the Heavenly Host, praiſing God, and ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; Glory to God in the Highest, on Earth Peace, Good Will towards Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>After this manner was the <hi>Appearance</hi> of our Saviour, and much after the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner was his following <hi>Life.</hi> It was a life of much Poverty and Meanneſs as to outward circumſtances; but it was a life in every Period of it fraught with Wonders. Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:63712:191"/>we conſider the admirable Goodneſs and Charmingneſs of his Temper; or the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary Vertue and Piety that did ſhine out in all his Converſation; Or the Divinity of his Sermons and Doctrines; Or his prodigi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous inimitable Miracles; Or the Atteſtations which were given to him from Heaven; Or the uſage he received from Men; Or the Events which followed upon all theſe things in the World.</p>
               <p>But it is his firſt <hi>Appearance</hi> in the <hi>Fleſh</hi> that we are this day met together to Commemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. And never had Mankind ſo Noble an Argument given them, to exerciſe their Thoughts and Meditations upon.</p>
               <p>If we conſider the <hi>Quality</hi> of the <hi>Perſon</hi> appearing, that he was no other than the Eternal Son of God: How ought we to be wrapt with Wonder and Aſtoniſhment at the Infiniteneſs of the Divine Condeſcenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? How ought we to be affected with Love and Thankfulneſs at ſuch a never-to-be-parallelled inſtance of God's kindneſs to us, that he ſhould <hi>ſo love us as to ſend his only begotten Son into the World, that we might live through him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we conſider that this Son of God reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving to appear in the World, of all other ways choſe to do it in our <hi>Fleſh,</hi> and ſo uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted both the <hi>Deity</hi> and <hi>Humanity</hi> in one <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon:</hi> O what a ſenſe ought this to impreſs upon us of the Honour that is here done to
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:63712:191"/>our Nature, and the Dignity it is advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to? And how ought that ſenſe, either to fright us, or to ſhame us from proſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this our Nature to any vile unworthy Mixtures and Communications, which God did not diſdain to take into ſo near a Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to himſelf.</p>
               <p>If we conſider that this <hi>God,</hi> in humane <hi>Fleſh,</hi> came as the <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> the Saviour of the World, ſo long before promiſed, and ſo long expected: How ought this to fill our hearts with Joy and Thankfulneſs? How ſhould it move us to pour out our Souls in Benedictions to God for having thus <hi>Viſited and Redeemed his People?</hi> And put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting us into that diſpenſation which ſo many Holy Men, for ſo many Ages, wiſhed to ſee, but did not ſee it; nay, and which the Angels themſelves deſired to look into; and which the <hi>Jews</hi> for rejecting, at the time it was publiſhed, are to this day a ſtanding Monument of God's Diſpleaſure and Ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance?</p>
               <p>If we conſider the many Evidences, that this our Saviour gave at his Appearance, of his being the true <hi>Christ;</hi> How exactly in all the Circumſtances of his <hi>Nativity,</hi> and all the Paſſages of his <hi>Life,</hi> he fulfilled the Prophecies which went before of him; and how convincing the Teſtimonies were, which God gave to the Truth of his Miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: How ought this Conſideration to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:63712:192"/>our Faith in this Chriſt? To make us conſtant to the death in owning him for our Saviour, our <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> in Oppoſition to all the Pretences of the Jews, and Infidels, and Atheiſts, and Scepticks to the contrary.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, If we conſider the mean Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that this our <hi>Christ</hi> choſe to appear in; ſo far below the Dignity of ſo great a Prince, that there is not the pooreſt Beggar's Child among us, but generally finds better Accommodation when it comes into the World: O what a Check, what a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke ought this to be to that Spirit of Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition, and Pride, and Vain-glory that too often poſſeſſes us poor Mortals? How ought it to take off our admiration, and leſſen the too great eſteem we are apt to have of all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Pomp and Greatneſs? Nay, and to make us deſpiſe all the glittering Shews and and Bravery of the World: Since God has given us ſo viſible a demonſtration, by the ſending his own Son into it, how little a Value he ſets upon theſe Things. But,</p>
               <p n="2">II. I proceed to the <hi>Second</hi> Point, which my Text leads me to ſpeak to, and that is the <hi>Time</hi> of our Saviour's <hi>Appearance</hi> here mentioned, <hi>Once hath he Appeared in the end of the World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You ſee here that the time of his Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance is ſaid to be the <hi>end of the World.</hi> But how is that to be underſtood? If we take the
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:63712:192"/>expreſſion in the literal ſenſe, and as we com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly uſe it; the thing is not true. For there have already paſſed near ſeventeen Hundred Years ſince our Saviour's Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; and yet the end of the World is not come, nor do we know when it will.</p>
               <p>But there will be no difficulty in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, if we carefully attend to the Phraſe the Apoſtle here uſeth, and interpret it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Propriety of the Language in which it is delivered. The word in my Text is <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, which every bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that is verſed in the ſtyle of the New Teſtament, knows may be better and more naturally rendred the <hi>Conſummation</hi> or <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion</hi> of the <hi>Ages,</hi> than the <hi>End</hi> of the <hi>World.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Fot the underſtanding this Phraſe, we muſt have recourſe to the known <hi>Idiom</hi> of the <hi>Jews,</hi> who uſed to ſpeak of the ſeveral <hi>Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomies</hi> and <hi>Diſpenſations,</hi> under which the World ſucceſſively had been, or was to be, as of ſo many <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> or <hi>Ages.</hi> The laſt of which <hi>Ages,</hi> and the Accompliſhment and Completion of all of them, they held to be the <hi>Age</hi> of the <hi>Meſſiah;</hi> beyond which they knew there was to be no other <hi>Age</hi> or <hi>Oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy.</hi> With reference to this way of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the times of the Goſpel-diſpenſation are frequently called in Scripture the <hi>Last Times,</hi> the <hi>Last Days,</hi> the <hi>Fulneſs of the Times,</hi> and in the Text, the <hi>Conſummation</hi> or <hi>Shutting</hi>
                  <pb n="378" facs="tcp:63712:193"/>up of the <hi>Ages.</hi> The meaning of all which Phraſes is no more than this. That the Times of the Goſpel, that is, the Appearance and Revelation of our Saviour; though God intended them from the beginning, yet ſhould they be the laſt of all Times. There ſhould be ſeveral Diſpenſations ſet on foot in the World before they came; and when thoſe times were fulfilled, when the Ends of thoſe Diſpenſations were accompli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed, then ſhould our Saviour appear, and begin his Kingdom which ſhould never be ſucceeded by any other.</p>
               <p>This is the true meaning of Chriſt's ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, as the Text expreſſeth it, that is, not (as we tranſlate it) in the <hi>end of the World,</hi> but in the laſt of the <hi>Ages,</hi> or at the time when the <hi>Ages</hi> were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled and accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>Now what uſe are we to make of this Conſideration, the Apoſtle himſelf doth fair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intimate to us in the beginning of this Epiſtle: <hi>God,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>who at ſundry times and in divers manners, ſpake in times past un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Fathers by the Prophets, hath in theſe last days ſpoken unto us by his Son, whom he hath made heir of all things, and by whom he made the Worlds.</hi> And ſo he goes on to ſet forth the incomparable Dignity and Prehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minence of this laſt Meſſenger of God, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove that of either Angels or Men, by whom he had ſpoken to Mankind before.
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:63712:193"/>But what is the inference he draws from all this? Why, That you may ſee in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the <hi>ſecond</hi> Chapter. <hi>We ought there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>to give the more earneſt heed to the things we have heard</hi> (that is to ſay, the Doctrine of the Goſpel) <hi>lest at any time we let them ſlip. For if the word ſpoken by Angels was ſtedfast, and every tranſgreſſion and diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience received a just recompence of reward; How ſhall we eſcape if we neglect ſo great Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as was ſpoken to us by the Lord</hi> Jeſus?</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle's Argument here proceeds on this manner. God's Revelation of his Will to Mankind, and the diſcovery of his Grace and Goodneſs was not all at once, but gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual and by parts.</p>
               <p>He firſt ſpake to Mankind by the <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archs</hi> who were burning and ſhining Lights in their Generations.</p>
               <p>He afterwards ſingles out the Nation of the <hi>Jews</hi> to be his peculiar People, and to them he gives a written Law which was delivered to them <hi>by Angels in the hand of</hi> Moſes <hi>their Mediator</hi> (as the Apoſtle ſpeaks in the <hi>third of the Galatians</hi>) which Law was a ſhadow or dark repreſentation of the Good things which were afterwards to be revealed.</p>
               <p>After this he ſends <hi>Prophets</hi> in a continual Succeſſion for ſeveral Ages, who do more clearly diſcover God's will to them; who call upon them to Holineſs and Virtue; and
<pb n="380" facs="tcp:63712:194"/>who ſpeak in very plain Terms of that <hi>Great Salvation</hi> which God ſhould one day mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt to the World.</p>
               <p>And laſt of all, as the Lord of the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard in the Parable dealt with his Husband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, who after he had ſent Servants one af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter another, of different Qualities and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees, at laſt ſent his own Son: So at laſt, I ſay, did the great Lord of the World, <hi>when the fulneſs of the time was come,</hi> ſend his own Son to be his Embaſſador to Mankind, his own Son who was the <hi>Brightneſs of his Glory, and the expreſs Image of his Perſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If now, as the Apoſtle here argues: If under the former Diſpenſations, when God only declared his Will by Angels or by Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, he was yet ſo ſevere that no Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion or Diſobedience eſcaped without a juſt recompence of Vengeance; <hi>How can we eſcape if we neglect ſo great a Salvation,</hi> as that was, which in theſe laſt days was <hi>preached by Jeſus Christ? How can we eſcape,</hi> if theſe laſt and greateſt Methods of God for our good, and in which all the Treaſures of his Goodneſs are diſplayed; I ſay, if theſe have no effect upon us in order to the mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us both Holy and Happy.</p>
               <p>What Teachers, what Inſtructers can we further expect? What new Lights or Aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances do we yet wait for? Can any one think that God ſhould ſet on foot ſome other new Diſpenſation for the bringing off thoſe
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:63712:194"/>wretched People upon whom this laſt could prevail nothing? Do we dream of another <hi>Covenant,</hi> or another <hi>Mediator</hi> between God and Man, beſides <hi>Christ Jeſus?</hi> Do we fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy that God will ſend ſome other Embaſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor or Saviour into the World after he hath ſent his own Son? Or that the Son of God will come a <hi>ſecond</hi> time in Humane Fleſh, and again be crucified for us?</p>
               <p>No certainly, God hath afforded the laſt and greateſt means for Man's <hi>Salvation,</hi> and no other is ever to be expected. <hi>Christ hath once appeared in the end of the World to put away Sin by the Sacrifice of himſelf;</hi> and to thoſe that believe in him and love him, and obey him, <hi>will he appear the ſecond time to their alvation.</hi> But never will he <hi>appear</hi> again to make a new Reconciliation for thoſe Men, that are not reconciled to God by his firſt Appearance. To ſuch (as our Apoſtle ſpeaks in the <hi>Tenth Chapter) There remains no more Sacrifice for Sin, but a fearful expectation of Judgment and fiery Indignation to conſume the Adverſaries.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. The <hi>Third</hi> General Point I am to inſiſt on from the Text is the <hi>End</hi> of our Saviour's <hi>Appearance;</hi> and that is here ſaid to be the <hi>putting away of Sin. Once in the end of the World hath he appeared to put away Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is that which the Scripture every where aſſigns as the Buſineſs and Deſign of
<pb n="382" facs="tcp:63712:195"/>Chriſt's coming. To run over all the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Texts would be tedious in ſo plain a Caſe. I ſhall therefore only name <hi>one</hi> or <hi>two.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the Account that St. <hi>John</hi> gives of his Appearance, 1 <hi>Ep.</hi> Ch. 3. <hi>Ye know,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that he was manifeſted to take away our Sins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And again, this is the account that the Angel gives to <hi>Joſeph</hi> a little before his Birth, <hi>Mat.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Fear not,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>to take unto thee Mary thy Wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Ghost. And ſhe ſhall bring forth a Son, and thou ſhalt call his Name Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his People from their ſins.</hi> He was called <hi>Jeſus</hi> becauſe he was deſigned by God to be our <hi>Saviour;</hi> for ſo much that word im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports. And he is therefore our <hi>Saviour,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he <hi>ſaves</hi> his People from their <hi>Sins,</hi> which is in the words of the Text, <hi>to put them away.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what is it to be <hi>ſaved from our Sins,</hi> or to <hi>have our Sins put away?</hi> Since the Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation we have by Chriſt doth conſiſt in this, it is fit we ſhould a little more particularly inſiſt on it. In Anſwer therefore to this Queſtion, we ſay that <hi>two</hi> things are implyed in Chriſt<hi>'s putting away Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> His <hi>ſaving</hi> or delivering us from the <hi>Guilt</hi> of our Sins, and the <hi>Puniſhment</hi> due to them.</p>
               <pb n="383" facs="tcp:63712:195"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> His <hi>ſaving</hi> or delivering us from the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> of them.</p>
               <p>In theſe <hi>two</hi> things conſiſts the <hi>Salvation</hi> obtained for us by <hi>Jeſus Christ;</hi> and if either of them was wanting, or was not effected, he would not be a compleat <hi>Saviour.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt, <hi>Christ appeared to put away Sin,</hi> by delivering us from the Guilt and Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it; that is to ſay, by procuring for us the Pardon and Remiſſion of it.</p>
               <p>This is the <hi>Salvation</hi> which <hi>Zachary</hi> in his Hymn foretels <hi>John Baptist</hi> ſhould publiſh to the World, <hi>Luke</hi> 1. <hi>To give knowledge of ſalvation to his people for the Remiſſion of their ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And this is that <hi>Redemption</hi> of Chriſt which St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeaks of, 1 <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 14. <hi>In whom we have redemption through his blood, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the forgiveneſs of ſins.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And laſtly, St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Sermon to the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles is, <hi>Be it known unto you, Men and Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, that through this Man Jeſus Christ is preached unto you the forgiveneſs of ſins, and by him all that believe are juſtified from all things from which ye could not be juſtified by the Law of Moſes,</hi> Acts. 13. And therefore much leſs certainly by the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The effect of theſe Texts is, That all Mankind are Sinners, are <hi>concluded under Sin, are become Guilty before God,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks. The moſt innocent Perſon is not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. All without exception have by
<pb n="348" facs="tcp:63712:196"/>their Sins <hi>fallen ſhort of the Glory of God.</hi> Means now for the freeing themſelves from the <hi>Guilt</hi> of theſe Sins they have none, nor is it poſſible they ſhould have, for that wholly depends upon the pleaſure of Him to whom they have rendred themſelves ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noxious; and that is God, the Governour of the World. Here therefore appears the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Mercy of God, and the Kindneſs of our Saviour. The Eternal <hi>Word</hi> interpoſeth and offers himſelf to become <hi>Man,</hi> and in that Perſon to make ſatisfaction for the Sins of the World. And God accepts the Terms. And hereupon a Covenant is made between God and Mankind; wherein God for his part upon account of this Mediation of Chriſt, promiſes Forgiveneſs of all Sins, to all true Penitents all the World over.</p>
               <p>O joyful Tidings theſe! What eaſe is here to wounded Conſciences? What comfort to deſpairing Sinners? What encouragement to all Men every where to repent?</p>
               <p>If we conſider Mankind in their pure <hi>Naturals,</hi> and as without Chriſt Jeſus, this plainly was their Caſe. They did believe a Supreme God; and their Reaſon it is likely would tell them that God was Good and Merciful. But yet this Reaſon could diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver no more than God's <hi>general</hi> Goodneſs to them that all along endeavoured to pleaſe and approve themſelves to Him. But as for his Willingneſs to pardon and forgive Sinners,
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:63712:196"/>eſpecially thoſe that had offended him by very grievous Crimes, or lived in a long habitual courſe of Wickedneſs; this they could not conclude from their Reaſon. Nay, if they did reaſon as they juſtly might, they might rather be inclined to believe that he would not pardon ſuch Criminals. For as their Reaſon told them, that God was <hi>Good:</hi> So the ſame Reaſon told them that he was <hi>Just,</hi> and had an infinite Regard to the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and Reputation of his <hi>Laws.</hi> Which Laws, their own Conſciences told them, they had heinouſly tranſgreſſed; nor had they any thing wherewith to compenſate or make ſatisfaction for the Tranſgreſſion of them: And therefore what could they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from ſo <hi>Just</hi> a God, but to undergo the puniſhment they had deſerved?</p>
               <p>This was a very uncomfortable Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. And yet ſuch a one it was, as there was no anſwer to be given to, in the State of <hi>Nature;</hi> and therefore in what a melancholy Condition were Mankind all the while? What encouragement had they ſeriouſly to ſet upon the Amendment of their wicked Lives? Or, if they did, what Fruit, what Comfort could they promiſe to themſelves by ſuch an amendment?</p>
               <p>But Bleſſed be God that hath removed us out of theſe uncertainties; Bleſſed be God that hath given us the greateſt aſſurance that is poſſible, of his Love and Kindneſs to the
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:63712:197"/>greateſt of Sinners; and conſequently laid the greateſt Obligation upon all Mankind to turn from their evil Ways.</p>
               <p>He hath ſent his Son, his only Son into the World, on purpoſe to aſſure us of his good Will to us; to give a demonſtration of the unfeigned Love and Kindneſs that He bears to every Soul of the Sons of <hi>Adam; that he would not have any of them periſh, but that they ſhould all come to the knowledge of the Truth,</hi> and be ſaved. This Son of His doth moſt Solemnly in the Name of his Father, proclaim Pardon and Remiſſion of Sins to every one that ſhould believe in Him. There is no Sinner excepted, even the <hi>Oldest,</hi> the <hi>Greatest,</hi> the moſt <hi>Enormous</hi> of Sinners, if they will come in, and ſubmit to the Yoke of Jeſus Chriſt, have his certain Promiſe that they ſhall be received.</p>
               <p>And leaſt any one ſhould fear the Divine <hi>Juſtice,</hi> upon account that there is no <hi>ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction</hi> made to it for his Sins: Our Lord hath taken care to remove that Objection. For he by the unvaluable Merits of his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the free unconſtrained Offering up of Himſelf to an ignominious Death upon the Croſs, on the behalf of Mankind, hath made a full, compleat and entire Satisfaction to God's Juſtice for all the Sins of the World, from the beginning to the end thereof.</p>
               <pb n="387" facs="tcp:63712:197"/>
               <p>So that now every one hath free Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to God, and a Right to his Favour through the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt. And though we have been never ſo bad, never ſo unworthy; yet if we have but the Hearts to forſake our Sins, and come to Jeſus Chriſt, we ſhall as certainly obtain the Acceptance and the Love of our Heavenly Father, as if we had been Innocent and never ſinned at all.</p>
               <p>Nay, God is not only willing to receive us, but he earneſtly begs and ſollicits us to take his Mercy. And ſo pleaſed he is at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of a Sinner, that our Saviour has told us <hi>there is joy in Heaven</hi> over ſuch a one. Nay, <hi>more joy among the Angels over a ſinner that repenteth; than over ninety nine juſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons that need no Repentance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O how welcome ought this News to be to us! How tranſported ſhould we be at the infinite Kindneſs of God manifeſted to us by our Saviour! O! praiſed be God for his aſtoniſhing Love. For ever adored be our Lord Jeſus, that has made a <hi>Propitiation</hi> for us by his Blood. O let us for ever kiſs and hug the pretious unvaluable <hi>Scriptures</hi> of the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> if there was nothing elſe in them but that <hi>faithful Saying,</hi> that Saying, <hi>worthy of all Men to be received, That Jeſus Christ came into the World to ſave Sinners;</hi> to ſave you, and me, and all Sinners, even the greateſt of Sinners.</p>
               <pb n="388" facs="tcp:63712:198"/>
               <p>O! who is there that is in his Wits, would chuſe to be out of the Chriſtian Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation; or be left to the Methods of <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture</hi> and <hi>Philoſophy</hi> for the attaining their Happineſs, as ſome looſe People among us do ſometimes talk. Were the natural Talents of Mankind exalted far above what they either are, or ever have been; yet I would value that one Saying, <hi>That Jeſus Christ came into the World to ſave Sinners,</hi> more than all the Notions and Speculations of Reaſon and Philoſophy. I would deſire to <hi>know nothing but Jeſus Christ, and him crucified.</hi> I would, with the Apoſtle, <hi>count all things as loſs,</hi> nay, <hi>as Dung, in compariſon of the Excellency of the Knowledge of Christ Jeſus my Saviour; and that I may be found in him, not having my own Righteouſneſs,</hi> which is by Nature, <hi>but that Righteouſneſs which is by the Faith of Jeſus Christ, who gave himſelf for me.</hi> And thus much of Chriſt's <hi>appearing to put away Sin,</hi> in the firſt Notion of that Expreſſion.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Secondly,</hi> Chriſt appeared <hi>to put away Sin</hi> in another ſenſe: That is to ſay, To de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy the <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Dominion</hi> of it from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Men; to <hi>aboliſh it,</hi> ſo as that it ſhould not henceforth <hi>reign in our mortal Bodies. To free us from Sin,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, that is, to enable us to lead holy and virtuous Lives. So that whereas Mankind hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>yielded their Members Servants to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs, and to iniquity unto iniquity; ſo they
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:63712:198"/>ſhould now yield their Members Servants to righteouſneſs unto holineſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus to <hi>put away Sin</hi> was as principal an End of Chriſt's coming as the other before mentioned; nay, perhaps more principal: For the other, in true reaſoning, may be ſaid to be wholly in order to this. Certain it is, unleſs this End be attained, the other will ſignifie nothing to us: For we are not capable of any Benefit from that <hi>Remiſſion</hi> of Sin which was purchaſed for us by Chriſt, until our Sins be <hi>put away</hi> by Repentance, and and we become holy Perſons by the change and renewal of our Natures.</p>
               <p>Never therefore let us deceive our ſelves. Though Chriſt hath actually <hi>put away</hi> all the Sins of the World in the former ſenſe by his ſatisfaction; that is to ſay, hath procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Pardon of them; hath taken away the <hi>Sting</hi> of them, ſo as that they ſhall not be deadly to any: Yet all this is upon ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that the <hi>Strength</hi> of them be taken away in us; that they <hi>have no Dominion over us;</hi> that we <hi>mortifie</hi> them in all our <hi>Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers;</hi> that we daily die to them, and live a Life of Righteouſneſs. All that Chriſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited or purchaſed for the World, will not do us the leaſt good, unleſs we be made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to him in his <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> by our <hi>dying to Sin and living to Righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And in truth, if we will mind it, the <hi>putting away Sin</hi> in this ſenſe of it, hath as
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:63712:199"/>great weight laid upon it in Scripture, and is as often aſſigned for the great End and Buſineſs of Chriſt's appearance as the other.</p>
               <p>St. <hi>John</hi> tells us plainly, that <hi>for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe was the Son of God manifeſted, that he might deſtroy the works of the Devil.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And St. <hi>Paul</hi> likewiſe tells us, that he therefore <hi>gave himſelf for us, that he might redeem us from all iniquity, and purifie to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a peculiar people zealous of good works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And <hi>laſtly,</hi> St. <hi>Peter</hi> gives the ſame ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of his coming, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.26. where he tells us, that therefore <hi>God raiſed up his Son Jeſus,</hi> that is, ſent him into the World (for his <hi>raiſing up</hi> there ſpoken of, as any one will ſee that looks into the Context, was not his being <hi>raiſed</hi> from the dead, but his being manifeſted to Mankind. For here the Apoſtle's buſineſs is to apply that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe or Propheſie of <hi>Moſes</hi> unto our Saviour, <hi>viz. That God would</hi> in due time <hi>raiſe up to his People a Prophet like unto him,</hi> whom they ſhould all be obliged to hearken to.) I ſay therefore <hi>God raiſed up his Son Jeſus,</hi> i. e. ſent him into the World, <hi>that he might bleſs his People, in turning every one of them from their Iniquities.</hi> This turning every one from their Iniquities was the great End for which our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was manife<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſted unto Mankind.</p>
               <pb n="391" facs="tcp:63712:199"/>
               <p>And indeed <hi>Reaſon</hi> will teach us all this, as well as <hi>Revelation.</hi> For in the nature of the thing, none can be truly <hi>Happy</hi> but thoſe that are truly <hi>Pious.</hi> And in the ſame de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree and proportion that any one is <hi>wicked,</hi> or is under the power of his Luſts, in the ſame degree he muſt needs be miſerable. So that if Chriſt came to be our Saviour, and in that, meant either to make us hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, or to keep us from being miſerable; there was an abſolute neceſſity that his firſt and principal Deſign muſt be to root out of our Nature all Sin and Wickedneſs; and to reſtore the Image of God in our Minds, which conſiſts in unchangeable Purity and Holineſs and Goodneſs.</p>
               <p>Away therefore with all thoſe <hi>Hypotheſes</hi> that give ſuch an account of Chriſt's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into the World, as to make the ultimate End of it, to be the freeing us from Hell and Damnation, and purchaſing Heaven and Eternal Life for us, but without any reſpect had to the renewing our Natures, or the making us ſincerely Holy and Virtuous. All ſuch accounts of Chriſt's Undertaking, are monſtrouſly unreaſonable and abſurd.</p>
               <p>For not to inſiſt upon the manifeſt Affront they put upon God's <hi>Juſtice</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> in making Him the great <hi>Patron</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> whilſt they aſſert Him to be the <hi>Juſtifier</hi> of wicked Men even whilſt they continue wicked.</p>
               <pb n="392" facs="tcp:63712:200"/>
               <p>You cannot, as I ſaid, but ſee (in the firſt place) how very much ſuch Doctrines do diſparage the Love of our Saviour and leſſen his Undertaking. For whilſt he is here ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to have Redeemed us only from his Fathers Wrath, and the Puniſhment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent thereupon; leaving us in the mean time to the wickedneſs and impurity of our own Nature, which alone without the acceſſion of any other external <hi>Evil,</hi> is a miſery great enough: He is hereby rendred but half a Saviour; One that freed us indeed froman <hi>External</hi> Evil, but left us irremediably expoſed to an <hi>Internal</hi> one, as grievous as the other. One that delivered us from the apprehenſions of a <hi>Gibbet,</hi> or an <hi>Executio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner;</hi> but could not, or would not cure us of the inward <hi>Sickneſſes</hi> and <hi>Maladies,</hi> under which we languiſhed.</p>
               <p>But this is not all. In the <hi>ſecond</hi> place, it ought to be taken notice of, what an abſurd inconſiſtent Notion this kind of Doctrine gives us of the <hi>Happineſs</hi> of Mankind. For whilſt they ſuppoſe that a Man under the Power and Dominion of Sin, is capable of that Happineſs which Chriſt purchaſed for us in the other World (which Happineſs as both Scripture and Reaſon teſtifie, doth chiefly conſiſt in the enjoyment of God, and of his Excellencies and Perfections): They muſt at the ſame time ſuppoſe, that a Man may berendred happy by the enjoyment
<pb n="393" facs="tcp:63712:200"/>of that of which he has no Senſe, no Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception; or rather, to ſpeak properly, that he is the happieſt Creature alive in the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of an Object to which he has the greateſt averſion and antipathy in the World. Which, if it be not an abſurdity, I know not what is. When <hi>Light</hi> can have Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with Darkneſs, when <hi>God</hi> can have Fellowſhip with <hi>Belial;</hi> Then, and not till then, can a wicked Man, a Man that lives in Sin, and loves it, be capable of that Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs which Jeſus Chriſt hath purchaſed for us.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. The <hi>Fourth</hi> thing I ſhould ſpeak to from this Text, is the <hi>Means</hi> by which our Saviour brought to paſs the great <hi>End</hi> of his <hi>Appearance,</hi> viz. <hi>The putting away of ſin,</hi> Which means are ſaid to be the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of himſelf. <hi>Now once in the end of the World, hath he appeared to put away ſin by the ſacrifice of himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Two</hi> things ſhould be done in order to a juſt Diſcourſe upon this point.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt.</hi> To give an account, how the Death of Chriſt was a Means for <hi>the putting away of ſin</hi> in the firſt Senſe I gave, that is, the procuring the Pardon of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> How it was a Means of putting it away in the other Senſe, that is, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying or mortifying it in us.</p>
               <pb n="394" facs="tcp:63712:201"/>
               <p>But theſe things being Foreign to our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Buſineſs, and more proper for the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a <hi>Good-Friday</hi> Sermon. I ſhall ſay no more of them, but proceed to my laſt point.</p>
               <p n="5">V. The <hi>Fifth</hi> and laſt thing obſervable from the Text, is the difference of Chriſt's <hi>ſacrifice,</hi> whereby <hi>he put away ſin,</hi> from the Moſaical ones. Which difference, ſo far as it is here taken notice of, conſiſts in this. That the <hi>Legal Sacrifices</hi> for the Expiation of Sin were daily offered; But Chriſt offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the <hi>Sacrifice of himſelf</hi> but once, <hi>Once in the end of the World,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The Apoſtle in this Chapter is diſcourſing of the Difference between the Law and the Goſpel. And as to that Point, he inſiſts much on the Difference of their Sacrifices. The Chriſtians that owned the Goſpel had but one Sacrifice, the Sacrifice of Chriſt once offered; whereas thoſe that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Law were forced to have many. Nay, even the moſt ſolemn Sacrifice that God had appointed for the Expiation of their Sins was repeated once a Year, as the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle tells us in the Verſe before my Text. But now the Sacrifice of Chriſt, which he puts by way of oppoſition to theirs, That was but once offered, and was never to be repeated. This is the point with which he concludes this Chapter; two Verſes after my Text, <hi>Christ,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>was once offered to
<pb n="395" facs="tcp:63712:201"/>bear the ſins of many, and unto them that look for him ſhall he appear the ſecond time unto ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the Apoſtle's Doctrine, and I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt on it now, becauſe all thoſe that deſign on this day to receive the <hi>Holy Sacrament</hi> are concerned in it.</p>
               <p>Let us from hence take notice, that in this Service of the <hi>Holy Communion,</hi> we are not to pretend to offer Chriſt as a Sacrifice to his Father: His Sacrifice was but once to be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and that was done 1600 Years ago; and in the Virtue of that Sacrifice once of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, all faithful Chriſtians and ſincere Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents ſhall receive Remiſſion of Sins, and all other Benefits of his Paſſion. But for us to think of offering Chriſt again as a Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice, is in effect to put our ſelves into the ſame rank and condition with the unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Jews, that is, to need the repetition of the ſame Sacrifices every Year, nay every Day, which is the very reaſon for which the Apoſtle denys the Efficacie of them.</p>
               <p>We do not indeed deny, but that every time we approach to the Lord's Table for the receiving of the Holy Communion, we offer Sacrifices to God: For we offer our <hi>Alms,</hi> which we beg of God to accept as our <hi>Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions;</hi> and theſe in the Language of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, are <hi>Sacrifices with which God is well pleaſed.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="396" facs="tcp:63712:202"/>
               <p>We likewiſe offer our <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Praiſe</hi> and <hi>Thankſgiving</hi> to God for the Death of our Saviour. And all our <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Suppli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations</hi> we put up in his <hi>Name,</hi> and in the <hi>Virtue,</hi> and for the Merits of that <hi>Sacrifice</hi> he offered to God in our behalf: And in ſo doing we <hi>commemorate</hi> that <hi>Sacrifice</hi> both to God, and before Men. And this is all, we are confident, that the Ancient Church meant by the great <hi>Chriſtian Sacrifice</hi> or the <hi>Sacrifice of the Altar.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But if we go further, if we will in the Communion pretend to offer up the Body and Blood of Chriſt in Sacrifice to God, that was once ſacrificed upon the Croſs: It is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tolerable. It is a thing that was never dreamed of in the firſt Ages of the Church: It is directly contradictory to the Foundation of all the Apoſtle's Argument and Diſcourſe here in the Text; and the very ſuppoſal of it brings along with it many grievous Abſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dities in the <hi>Theory,</hi> and ſomething that looks like <hi>impious</hi> in the <hi>Practice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And yet this is the conſtant and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed Doctrine and Practice of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> in every <hi>Sacrament</hi> they have, and that is in every <hi>Maſs</hi> that is ſaid among them. The main buſineſs of that Myſtery they make to conſiſt in the Prieſt's offering up to God the very <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> of Chriſt, the ſame <hi>Body</hi> and <hi>Blood</hi> that was once offered up at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> this
<pb n="397" facs="tcp:63712:202"/>they pretend to offer up as a Sacrifice every day: And they attribute to this their Offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſame Virtue and Efficacy that the Apoſtles and all Chriſtians have always at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the one <hi>Sacriſice</hi> of Chriſt upon the Croſs; that is, that it is <hi>a true propitiato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Sacrifice for the Living and for the Dead:</hi> And none among them dare deny this, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der pain of an <hi>Anathema.</hi> as the <hi>Council</hi> of <hi>Trent</hi> hath ordered the matter.</p>
               <p>Good God! whither will Intereſt and Faction and Zeal for a Party tranſport Men? But it is not my buſineſs to expoſe <hi>them,</hi> but to put you in mind of what concerns our ſelves, namely, as I ſaid, that when we come to the Lord's Table, we do not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach thither with a belief that our Lord Jeſus is there again <hi>offered,</hi> but only with a deſign to commemorate his <hi>Sacrifice</hi> that was once offered. We come not thither to <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> Chriſt, but to be Partakers of his <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice.</hi> We are not to feaſt God; but God there feaſts us, and that with the beſt Food in the World: ſuch Food as will nouriſh us to Eternal Life, if we be worthy Gueſts: Only we muſt not <hi>appear before God empty</hi> at this Solemnity: We muſt <hi>offer</hi> to him of our <hi>Subſtance:</hi> We muſt <hi>offer</hi> our <hi>Prayers</hi> and <hi>Supplications,</hi> not only for our ſelves, but for all the World; but more eſpecially for all that are called by the Name of Chriſt; and among thoſe, moſt particularly for our own
<pb n="398" facs="tcp:63712:203"/>
                  <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and all Orders and Degrees of Men therein. We muſt <hi>offer</hi> likewiſe our ſelves, our Souls and Bodies a <hi>living ſacrifice, holy and acceptable to God, which is our reaſonable ſervice.</hi> And laſtly, to conclude, we muſt <hi>offer</hi> our moſt hearty and affectionate Thanks to God Almighty, for that incomprehenſible Inſtance of his Love in ſending Chriſt Jeſus to us to be our Saviour; for his wonderful <hi>Birth,</hi> for his holy <hi>Life,</hi> for his pretious <hi>Death,</hi> for his glorious <hi>Reſurrection</hi> and <hi>Aſcenſion,</hi> and for his <hi>Interceſſion</hi> for us at the right hand of God.</p>
               <p>And O thou Bleſſed Saviour that haſt done all this for us, give us ſuch a lively Senſe of thy marvelous Love in leaving thy Glory, and taking Humane Fleſh upon thee, that thou mighteſt dwell among us, and inſtruct us in our Duty, and aſſiſt us in the perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance of it, and encourage us thereto by the glorious Hopes of a never dying Life, and at laſt make thy ſelf an Offering for our Sins! O let theſe things ſink ſo deeply in our Minds, and ſo wholly poſſeſs our Hearts, that we may entirely give up our ſelves to thee! That we may with our whole Souls embrace all thy <hi>Doctrines</hi> and <hi>Revelations:</hi> That we may endeavour in all our Actions to conform our ſelves to thy <hi>Example;</hi> and make it the Buſineſs of our Lives to be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to thy <hi>Precepts,</hi> to ſubmit to thy <hi>Will,</hi>
                  <pb n="399" facs="tcp:63712:203"/>and to be contented to be diſpoſed of by thee in all the Circumſtances of our Lives. O let nothing in thy Religion ever be an <hi>Offence</hi> to us! But enable us to hold <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of our Faith</hi> in thee <hi>without wavering,</hi> in all the Tryals and Difficulties thou ſhalt think fit to expoſe us to; that ſo in Faith and Obedience, in Patience and Perſeverance, we may ever wait for, and at laſt obtain that <hi>Crown of Righteouſneſs which thou hast laid up for all that love thee, and expect thy</hi> ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond and more glorious <hi>Appearance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To thee, O eternal Son of God, thou great Lover of Mankind; to Thee, <hi>who tookest upon thee to deliver Man, and didst not abhor the Virgins womb;</hi> to thee, <hi>who over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camest the ſharpneſs of death, and didst open the Kingdom of Heaven to all believers:</hi> To thee, O moſt dear, O moſt beloved, O moſt adorable Jeſus, be for ever given by us, and by all the Souls whom thou haſt redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and by all the Creatures in Heaven and Earth, all Honour, and Glory, and Praiſe, all Service and Love and Obedience, hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forth and for evermore.</p>

               <p>WE ſhall eaſily ſee the Deſign of theſe Words, and what uſe we are to make of them, if we look at their Connexion with the Diſcourſe that goes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. St. <hi>Paul</hi> in this Chapter, ſets himſelf to ſhew the Excellency, and the great Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of the <hi>Knowledge</hi> of Jeſus Chriſt,
<pb n="402" facs="tcp:63712:205"/>and how inconſiderable, how unworthy to be named in compariſon therewith, all thoſe things were, that the Jews his Country-men ſo much gloried in. His Diſcourſe upon this occaſion is ſo very remarkable, that it will he worth our while to run over the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>I alſo</hi> (ſaith he in the <hi>4th.</hi> verſe) <hi>might have conſidence in the fleſh.

Nay, there is not a Jew among you that perhaps can ſay ſo much on his own behalf in this reſpect, as I can.</p>
               <p>For (as he goes on in the <hi>5th.</hi> and <hi>6th.</hi> ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.) <hi>I was circumciſed the eighth day, of the Stock of Iſrael, of the Tribe of Penjamin, an Hebrew of the Hebrews: as touching the Law, a Phariſee: concerning Zeal, perſecuting the Church: touching the Righteouſneſs, which is by the Law, blameleſs.</hi>

               <p>That is to ſay, I have not only the Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a Son of <hi>Abraham</hi> upon me, being <hi>circumciſed;</hi> but I am alſo of the Race of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

               <p>But now, am I much the better for all theſe things? Have I any great reaſon to glory up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="404" facs="tcp:63712:206"/>the account of them? No, verily, (as he goes on in the <hi>7th.</hi> verſe) <hi>but what things were gain to me, thoſe I counted loſs for Chriſt.</hi> All theſe outward Advantages, my Birth, my Profeſſion, my Sect, my Reputation, my ſtrict way of living, which might have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved very beneficial to me in all worldly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects; when I once came to the knowledge of the Chriſtian Religion, I diſpiſed them all: For in truth I found that they were ſo far from being real Advantages to me, that they were rather hindrances in the way of Vertue and Piety.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Yea doubtleſs</hi> (as he goes on in the <hi>8th.</hi> verſe) <hi>I account all things but loſs for the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus my Lord, for whom I have ſuffered the loſs of all things, and do count them but dung that I may win Chriſt.</hi> That is to ſay, Not only the above-named priviledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, but all other things whatſoever, Wealth, Greatneſs, Fame, Friends, and Life it ſelf, I account them all very pitiful things if they be compared with the ineſtimable advantages of being a <hi>Chriſtian.</hi> As I have once, ſo I will again readily forſake all, part with all things that the World holds moſt dear and valuable, nay, I will trample them under my feet like <hi>dirt</hi> and <hi>dung;</hi> provided I may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Favour of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And</hi> (as he goes on in the <hi>9th.</hi> verſe) <hi>that I might be found in him, not having my own Righteouſneſs, which is of the Law, but that
<pb n="405" facs="tcp:63712:206"/>which is by the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which is of God by Faith.</hi> This paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage hath been frequently miſunderſtood, and interpreted to a ſenſe that I believe St. <hi>Paul</hi> did not think of. St. <hi>Paul</hi> doth not here oppoſe an <hi>inherent Righteouſneſs</hi> to an <hi>imputed</hi> one; but an <hi>outward, natural, legal</hi> Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to that which is <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>ſpiritual,</hi> and wrought in a Man by the Spirit of God. The <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> which the Apoſtle here deſires to be found in, is not the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Chriſt</hi> made his, or <hi>imputed</hi> to him; but a <hi>real</hi> Righteouſneſs produced in his Soul by the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>The plain Senſe of the Verſe ſeems to be this. That which above all things I deſire is <hi>to be found in Chriſt,</hi> i. e. to be found a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciple of his; ingrafted into him by being a Member of his Church, <hi>not having my own Righteouſneſs which is of the Law,</hi> i. e. not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing content with thoſe <hi>outward</hi> Priviledges, and that <hi>outward</hi> Obedience which by my own natural Strength, I am able to yield to the Precepts of the Law, which is that <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> in which the Jews place their Confidence, and by which they expect to be juſtified before God; <hi>But that which is by the Faith of Jeſus Chriſt, the Righteouſneſs which is of God by Faith;</hi> i. e. that Righteouſneſs which I deſire, and in which only I ſhall have the Confidence to appear before God, is an inward Principle of Holineſs; that Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:63712:207"/>renewed Obedience to God's I aws which he doth require as the condition of his Favour and Acceptance, and which I can never attain to, but by the <hi>Faith of Chriſt;</hi> by becoming a Chriſtian. This is none of my own Righteouſneſs but God's, it being wrought in me by his Spirit, accompanying the preaching of the Goſpel; and as it is his Gift, ſo he will own it, and reward it at the laſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>Thus have I given you a full account of the Text, and all the Apoſtle's Diſcourſe that it depends upon, I now come to treat more
<pb n="407" facs="tcp:63712:207"/>particularly of it with reſerence to the ſolem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of this Day.</p>
               <p>We all here preſent do profeſs to believe the Article of our Saviour's <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and our buſineſs at this time is to celebrate the memory of it. But we muſt not reſt here. We are not to look upon our Lord's <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> meerly as a thing to be believed, or profeſſed, or commemorated; or as a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Fact that only concerned <hi>himſelf:</hi> But there is a great deal in it which doth nearly concern us. The Apoſtle tells us, there is a great <hi>Power</hi> in it; even a <hi>Power</hi> of raiſing us from Sin to a Holy and Vertuous Life. It is ſo ordered, as to be capable of being, and it ought to be, a Principle of <hi>now Life</hi> in us, as it was the beginning of a <hi>now Life</hi> in our Saviour. Now this Vertue, this Power, this Efficacy of it, as it is that, which with the Apoſtle we ought all moſt earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to endeavour the experiencing in our ſelves; ſo it is that which will be fitteſt for us at this time to apply our Meditations to.</p>
               <p>My Work therefore at this time ſhall be to give ſome Account of the <hi>Power of Chriſt's Reſurrection</hi> in order to the making Men good, which the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of; to ſhew how, or in what reſpects it doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtuence upon the Lives of Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>Now if we look into the Holy Scriptures, we ſhall find that there is a <hi>four-fold</hi> Power attributed to it, or that it hath an inſluence
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:63712:208"/>upon our Lives in theſe <hi>four</hi> reſpects. That is to ſay,</p>
               <list>
                  <item>I. As it lays an <hi>Obligation</hi> upon Chriſtians to <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Vertue.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>II. As it is the Principal <hi>Evidence</hi> of the Truth of our Religion, the Deſign of which is to make Men <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Vertuous.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>III. As it is the great <hi>Support</hi> of our <hi>future Hopes,</hi> or our Hopes of another Life; which indeed is the main <hi>Encouragement</hi> we have to apply our ſelves ſeriouſly to the buſineſs of <hi>Holineſs</hi> and <hi>Vertue.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>IV. And <hi>Fourthly,</hi> as to it we do princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally owe all that ſupernatural <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Strength,</hi> by which we are <hi>inabled</hi> to live <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lily</hi> and <hi>Vertuouſly.</hi> Of theſe four Points I ſhall Diſcourſe very brieſly.</item>
               </list>
               <p n="1">I. And <hi>First</hi> of all, our Saviour's <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> hath an influence upon our Practice, as it lays an <hi>Obligation</hi> upon Chriſtians to lead Holy and Vertuous Lives. As it is in it ſelf an incitement to Piety, and heavenly-Mindedneſs.</p>
               <p>This is indeed the loweſt inſtance of its <hi>Power;</hi> but yet we ought not to paſs it by, becauſe the Writers of the New Teſtament do frequently inſiſt on it. For thus they ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue. If Chriſt was crucified for our Sins; then ought we to crucifie them in our mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers. And if Chriſt roſe again the third day; then are we ingaged in conformity to
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:63712:208"/>him to riſe again to newneſs of Life, to lead a Spiritual, Divine, <hi>Heavenly</hi> Life, ſuch a liſe as he now lives with God.</p>
               <p>And this in the ancient times was taught every Chriſtian in, and by his <hi>Baptiſm.</hi> When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a perſon was baptized, he was not only to profeſs his faith in Chriſt's <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,</hi> but he was alſo to look upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as obliged in correſpondence therewith, to mortifie his former carnal affections, and to enter upon a new ſtate of Life. And the very Form of <hi>Baptiſm</hi> did lively repreſent this Obligation to them. For what did their being plung'd under water ſignifie, but their Undertaking in Imitation of Chriſt's <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Burial,</hi> to forſake all their former evil courſes: As their aſcending out of the water did their Engagement to lead a holy, ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Life? This our Apoſtle doth more than once declare to us.</p>
               <p>Thus, <hi>Rom.</hi> vi. 4. <hi>We are buried</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>with Chriſt by Baptiſm unto death, that like as Chriſt was raiſed up from the dead, by the Glory of the Father, even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of Life.</hi> Thus again in the <hi>10th</hi> and <hi>11th</hi> verſes of that Chapter, <hi>In that Chriſt died, he died unto ſin once, but in that he liveth, he liveth unto God: likewiſe reckon ye your ſelves to be dead indeed unto ſin, but alive unto God through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> That is to ſay, After the example of Chriſt's <hi>Death</hi> and
<pb n="410" facs="tcp:63712:209"/>
                  <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> account ye your ſelves obliged to <hi>die</hi> to <hi>ſin,</hi> and to <hi>live</hi> to <hi>Righteouſneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Laſtly, To name no more Texts, the ſame uſe doth the Apoſtle make of Chriſt's <hi>Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection</hi> in <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> iii. 1, 2. <hi>If ye then</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek thoſe things which are above, where Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of God. i. e.</hi> You by entring into the Chriſtian Covenant are incorporated into Chriſt; He is your <hi>Head,</hi> you are his <hi>Members;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſince he no longer leads a life of this World, it will by no means become you to live like Worldlings or <hi>Epicures,</hi> but being <hi>riſen with him</hi> (as the Members ought to do with the Head) <hi>to mind thoſe things that are above</hi> where he is, <hi>to ſet your affections</hi> (as he goes on) <hi>on the things above, and not on the things of the Earth. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Chriſt in God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe things plainly ſhew that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles delivered the Doctrine of Chriſt's <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection,</hi> as a <hi>Practical</hi> Doctrine; as a point, which, if Chriſtians believed as they ſhould do, it would ingage them to mortifie their luſts, to die to the World, to place their af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections on Spiritual things, to have their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſations in Heaven, where Chriſt our <hi>Head,</hi> our <hi>Life,</hi> now ſits at the right hand of God.</p>
               <p n="2">II. Great will the inſluence and <hi>Power</hi> of Chriſt's <hi>Reſurrection</hi> upon our lives appear to be, when we conſider that it is indeed the
<pb n="411" facs="tcp:63712:209"/>principal Evidence that we have for the <hi>Truth</hi> of our <hi>Religion,</hi> the very deſign of which is to make us <hi>Vertuous</hi> and <hi>Holy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If any thing in the World can make a man good, it muſt be a hearty belief of the Goſpel. And if any thing in the World can make a man heartily to believe the Goſpel, it muſt be the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of our Saviour from the dead. All that <hi>Power</hi> therefore, that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt hath to make men good; all that force and efficacy that its Arguments, its Promiſes, its Precepts, its Encouragements, its. Threatnings, have upon the Underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Wills of men in order to bring them to Vertue and Holineſs; I ſay, all this may in a great meaſure uitimately be reſolved in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Article of Chriſt's Reſurrection. For this Reſurrection of his was the thing that did from the beginning, and doth now, and ever will aſcertain mankind of the Truth of Chriſt's Religion. This was, and will be for ever, the convincing Evidence, that what <hi>Jeſus</hi> taught was true Doctrine, that what he commanded was of perpetual obligation, that what he promiſed or threatned he was able to make good.</p>
               <p>If Chriſt had not riſen from the dead, but had for ever been detained in the Grave, notwithſtanding all that might be urged from the <hi>Goodneſs</hi> of his <hi>Doctrine,</hi> and the <hi>Inun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency</hi> of his <hi>Life,</hi> and the multitude of his <hi>Miracles,</hi> for the Proof of the Truth of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:63712:210"/>(though yet very ſtrong and conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Proofs theſe are) I doubt it would hardly have met with that ready Entertainment in the World, that we find it did. But a great many, both then and now, would have made the ſame Objection againſt Jeſus Chriſt and his Goſpel, that the <hi>Phariſees</hi> did of old; that is to ſay, That all his great Works and Miracles were done by Sorcery and Magick. And that as for the Innocency of his Life, and the great Vertue and Strictneſs that he ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in his Converſation; that was only uſed as a Trick and an Artifice the more eaſily to impoſe upon the World. But now, when it appears that <hi>Jeſus,</hi> who taught this holy Religion, who did thoſe Miracles, who liv'd that vertuous Life; did, after he was put to a cruel death, riſe again to Life, and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed upon earth for <hi>forty</hi> days together, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that, in the preſence of many Spectators did aſcend into Heaven: I ſay, when this appears (as God be thanked it is evident be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all contradiction) here is no room left for any ſuſpicion of this nature; but all pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of Impoſture do perfectly vaniſh. It is impoſſible for any conſidering man to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve Chriſt's Reſurrection, and at the ſame time to doubt of the truth of his Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.</p>
               <p>For thus let us reaſon. Chriſt over and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver again told his Apoſtles that he ſhould be put to death, but after that, he would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in
<pb n="413" facs="tcp:63712:210"/>three days riſe again. <hi>Matth.</hi> xvi. 21. xvii. 22. <hi>John.</hi> xvi. 16.</p>
               <p>Nay, he told this not only to the Apoſtles, but to all the People; nay, more than that, he gave this as a Token, as an Evidence to them whereby they ſhould know, and be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that he was, what he gave himſelf out to be, the Son of God and the great Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet and Saviour that was to come. <hi>John</hi> ii. 19.</p>
               <p>Nay, in the laſt place, he not only refers the Jews to his <hi>Reſurrection</hi> as an Evidence of his being the Chriſt, but as the laſt and greateſt Evidence that he had to give. And ſuch as if they were not convinced by, they muſt expect no other. <hi>Matth.</hi> xii. 39, 40.</p>
               <p>Our Saviour now laying ſuch a mighty ſtreſs upon this point of his Reſurrection, putting his whole cauſe (as I may ſpeak) upon this Iſſue: I ask, How is it poſſible to imagine, that God Almighty ſhould make theſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions of our Saviour, good; if he was not really what he pretended to be?</p>
               <p>If Chriſt had been an Impoſtor, it had been the eaſieſt matter in the World to have ſtifled all his pretences for ever. It had but been to have let him mouldered to duſt in his Grave, as all other men do, and as <hi>He,</hi> without the help of Omnipotency, would have done; and then all the World would have ſeen that he was a Deceiver. But now, when in ſtead of periſhing in the Grave, he
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:63712:211"/>was after three days reſtored to life again, as he had foretold the People; nay, to a glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, immortal Life; What are we to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude from hence?</p>
               <p>Did not God in this, appear with a wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as a Voucher and Approver of his cauſe? Was not this a demonſtration to all the World, that Chriſt Jeſus was no Deceiver, but that he came from God; and that what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he delivered was the Truth of God, and to be received as the Oracles of God? Certainly it was.</p>
               <p>For that a man ſhould be raiſed from the Dead by any other Power, than the very Power of God; all the World knows to be impoſſible. The Devil, though he can do very ſtrange Feats in the natural World: Yet I rever heard or read, that either he or any of his Agents or Miniſters, ſo much as pretended to raiſe the dead to life again. And certainly if he could have done it, he would have done it often before this, (as in the caſe of <hi>Apollonius Tyanaeus, Mahomet,</hi> and others) if it had been for no other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon than to baffle thereby the Evidence of our Saviour's <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and render it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concluding.</p>
               <p>Ir muſt therefore certainly be the Power of God that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead. But then to ſuppoſe that God ſhould employ this Tower for the giving Teſtimony to a Falſhood, that he ſhould ſet his own Seal
<pb n="415" facs="tcp:63712:211"/>to atteſt an Untruth, as he muſt be ſuppoſed to have done, if Jeſus was not his Son: What an unaccountable thing is this? No man that believes that God is faithful and juſt and true, and that he governs the World, can poſſibly imagine ſuch a thing. For this had been to have contradicted all his own Attributes, and to have laid an invincible temptation and ſnare before all mankind to believe an Impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lye. You ſee then what an unexcepti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable Proof, (nay Demonſtration I may call it) the <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of Chriſt doth afford us of the Truth of his Religion; which is the <hi>ſecond</hi> Inſtance of the <hi>Power</hi> that is in it to bring men over to Holineſs and Vertue.</p>
               <p n="3">III. But, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> the <hi>Power</hi> of Chriſt's <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection</hi> for the making us <hi>holy</hi> and <hi>vertuous</hi> will further appear in this reſpect. Namely, as it is in particular, the great ſupport of our Future Hopes; the great Pledge and Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of our own <hi>Reſurrection</hi> and <hi>Immorta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>For if Chriſt be riſen, then may we alſo be certain that we ſhall at laſt be raiſed by him. Becauſe Chriſt is not riſen for himſelf only, but <hi>as the firſt-fruits of them that ſlept,</hi> 1 Cor. xv. Good reaſon therefore had S. <hi>Paul</hi> to argue as he doth in that place, <hi>If Chriſt be preached that he is riſen from the dead; how ſay ſome among you, that there is no Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on?</hi> On the contrary (as he urges) <hi>If we
<pb n="416" facs="tcp:63712:212"/>believe that Jeſus Chriſt died and roſe again: Even ſo them alſo that ſleep in Jeſus will God bring with him.</hi> 1 Theſſ. iv. 14.</p>
               <p>For how can we deſire to be better aſſured that our <hi>Bodies</hi> ſhall not for ever ſleep in the Grave, but ſhall at laſt be reunited to our <hi>Souls,</hi> and both <hi>Soul</hi> and <hi>Body</hi> live eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in unſpeakable bliſs and happineſs; I ſay, How can we have greater aſſurance of this, than by what was on this day brought to paſs in our Saviour?</p>
               <p>We have hereby a clear demonſtration that the Reſurrection is poſſible. For Chriſt who was once dead is alive again, and lives in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible Glory, at the right hand of God. And at the ſame time that he roſe, he raiſed up other Bodies alſo of Holy Men to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany him in his Triumph over Death.</p>
               <p>But that is not all. He that raiſed up himſelf and them, hath given us his ſolemn Word and Promiſe, in as expreſs terms as is poſſible, that he will by the ſame Power raiſe up us alſo; and exalt us to the ſame Glory that he is poſſeſſed of. He hath told us, That he is <hi>the Reſurrection and the Life:</hi> And that <hi>whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall not periſh, but have everlaſting life; and he will raiſe him up at the laſt day.</hi> There cannot be a ſtronger Proof of any thing; than our Saviour's <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection</hi> is of the happineſs of good Men in another State.</p>
               <pb n="417" facs="tcp:63712:212"/>
               <p>Which being ſo; How powerful a means muſt we needs conclude it to be, for the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the manners of Mankind, and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them truly Holy and Vertuous?</p>
               <p>Since we have thereby ſuch a Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion given us of a glorious Immortality to be expected by us; what is it that can be able to hinder or divert us from a ſerious purſuit of thoſe things that lead to it? What could God do more by way of Motive and Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, towards the Proſelyting the World to Religion and Righteouſneſs, than he hath done, by thus Aſcertaining our future Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by the Reſurrection of his Son Jeſus?</p>
               <p>To be certain, that if we ſeriouſly apply our ſelves to a life of Piety here, we ſhall be crowned with everlaſting Felicity hereafter! To be certain, that if we follow the ſteps of our Bleſſed Saviour, we ſhall for ever ſhine in the ſame Glory and Luſtre that he now doth at the right hand of his Father! To be able poſitively to ſay, <hi>I know that my Redeemer liveth,</hi> and I know that if I live as he did, I ſhall for ever live with him; and tho' <hi>it doth not yet appear what I ſhall be,</hi> yet this I know, <hi>that when he ſhall appear I ſhall be like him!</hi> O what noble Thoughts, what brave Reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons is this able to inſpire us with? What Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties ſhall we be afraid of? What Labours ſhall we not willingly undertake? What Temptations ſhall we not eaſily vanquiſh in
<pb n="418" facs="tcp:63712:213"/>the Proſpect of ſuch an eternal Crown of Glory, as awaits us, and is ſecured to us by our Lord Jeſus?</p>
               <p>O happy we Chriſtians! that have ſo clear a Revelation of thoſe things, <hi>which God hath prepared for them that love him,</hi> thoſe things which <hi>eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither did they enter into the heart of man!</hi> Bleſſed, for ever bleſſed be our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, that hath <hi>begotten us again to this lively hope by his Roſurrection from the dead.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>O! what mighty Encouragements have we to ſet our ſelves againſt our Sins, and to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour after the <hi>Perfection</hi> of Vertue, in compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of what thoſe have who are ignorant of our Saviour's <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> and who know nothing of the other World but by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain conjectures of their natural Reaſon?</p>
               <p>If we had no other aſſurance of the <hi>Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality</hi> of the Soul, and the rewards and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments of another life, but what is affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded us by the light of Nature, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of Philoſophy; I doubt we could never expect to ſee any great Reformation in our manners.</p>
               <p>Some of the Philoſophers have indeed to their immortal Fame, aſſerted the truth of theſe things: But then others of them have as much made it their buſineſs to run them down. And as for thoſe of them that ſpoke the beſt concerning the other World, yet
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:63712:213"/>God knows, their Diſcourſes upon this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument (as will appear to any that reads them) are generally very uncertain, and altogether conjectural.</p>
               <p>But admitting their Reaſons to be ſtrong and concluſive (as I am far from denying, that the <hi>Souls Immortality</hi> is demonſtrable by the light of Nature) yet there are generally theſe two Inconveniences in the Arguments they make uſe of for the Proof of this matter, which render them in a great meaſure ineffectual for the reforming mens lives.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> They are generally of ſo great Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty, ſo Nice, ſo <hi>Metaphyſical,</hi> ſo much above the reach of ordinary Capacities, that they are uſeleſs to the greateſt part of Mankind, who have not underſtandings fitted for them.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Secondly,</hi> They have this inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence likewiſe, that a Man doth not ſee the Evidence of them, without actual attention to a long Train of Propoſitions; which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, it may be, when a Man moſt ſtands in need of their Support, he ſhall neither have the leiſure nor the humour to give.</p>
               <p>But now the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Method of proving another Life, is quite of another ſtrain, and wholly free from theſe inconveniences. That Demonſtration which Chriſt hath given us of a glorious <hi>Immortality</hi> by his Reſurrection from the dead, as it is infinitely certain and concluſive; ſo it is plain and eaſy, ſhort and
<pb n="420" facs="tcp:63712:214"/>compendious, powerful and operative. No Man that believes the matter of Fact, can deny the Cogency of it: Men of the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Capacities may apprehend it. Perſons in a crowd of buſineſs and in the midſt of temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations may attend to it. And it hath this Vertue beſides, that it leaves a laſting im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion upon the Spirits of thoſe that do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve and conſider it.</p>
               <p>Thanks therefore to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt for this excellent Inſtrument of Piety, that he hath given us by his <hi>Reſurrection.</hi> Everlaſting Praiſes to his name, that he hath thus <hi>brought Life and Immortality to light by his Goſpel.</hi> This very thing alone, was there nothing elſe to be ſaid for the Chriſtian Revelation, would ſufficiently juſtify both the Goſpel it ſelf, and our Lord Jeſus the Author of it, to all Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; nay, and effectually recommend his <hi>Religion,</hi> above all others that ever were taught, to all Perſons in all Nations of the World.</p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>Fourthly</hi> and Laſtly, There is ſtill a further Bleſſing coming to us by our Saviour's <hi>Reſurrection</hi> from the dead; and in which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is chiefly ſeen and expreſſed the great <hi>Power</hi> of it for the making us <hi>Holy</hi> and <hi>Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous.</hi> That is to ſay, Unto it we do princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally owe all that ſupernatural <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance</hi> by which we are enabled to vanquiſh
<pb n="421" facs="tcp:63712:214"/>our Corruptions, and to live up to the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of our Religion.</p>
               <p>As Chriſt by his Reſurrection did oblige us to <hi>lead new lives:</hi> As Chriſt by his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection did demonſtrate the truth of the Chriſtian Religion, which is wholly in order to our <hi>leading new lives:</hi> As by his Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he cleared up to us the certainty of our future State, and thereby gave us the greateſt Motive and Encouragement <hi>to lead new lives:</hi> So in the laſt place, by the ſame <hi>Reſurrection</hi> he acquired a Power of conferring Grace and Strength and Influence upon us, by the Virtue of which we are in fact inabled <hi>to lead new lives.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tho' Chriſt by his death reconciled us to God, and procured a Pardon of Sin for us; yet the actual benefit of this Reconciliation, the actual application of this Pardon, did depend upon our performance of certain Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions. Which conditions were, that we ſhould mortify all our evil affections, and frame our Lives ſuitable to the Laws of the Goſpel. But now the Grace and Power by which we are inabled to do this, was not the effect of Chriſt's <hi>Death,</hi> but of his <hi>Reſurrection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It was <hi>when he aſcended up on high, and led Captivity Captive,</hi> that is, when he had van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſhed <hi>Death,</hi> which had vanquiſhed all the World before: It was then, (as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture aſſures us) and not till then, that he was
<pb n="422" facs="tcp:63712:215"/>in a capacity <hi>of giving gifts unto men.</hi> It was not till he was <hi>glorified,</hi> as St. <hi>John</hi> obſerves, that <hi>the holy ſpirit was given.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Hence it is, that we every where find the Apoſtles attributing the buſineſs of Man's <hi>Juſtification</hi> and <hi>Salvation,</hi> as much, or more to Chriſt's <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> than to his <hi>Paſſion. If Chriſt be not riſen</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul,</hi> 1 Cor. xv.) <hi>your Faith is in vain, ye are yet in your Sins.</hi> Indeed, if Chriſt had periſhed in the Grave, we had ſtill had all the load of our ſins upon us; becauſe we had no aſſurance that God had accepted the Atonement and Propitiation which he had made for them. And much leſs could we have promiſed to our ſelves, that we ſhould have been aſſiſted by any Divine Power for the ſubduing of them.</p>
               <p>Again, the ſame St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us, <hi>Rom.</hi> iv. that <hi>Chriſt was delivered for our ſins, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed again for our juſtification.</hi> Chriſt's <hi>Death</hi> was the <hi>Sacrifice,</hi> the <hi>Satisfaction</hi> for our Sins. But it was by the means of his <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> that that Sacrifice and Satisfaction is applied to us and we for the merits of it become <hi>juſtified</hi> before God.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly,</hi> To name no more Texts, <hi>Who</hi> (ſaith the ſame <hi>Apoſtle,</hi> Rom. viii.) <hi>ſhall lay any thing to the charge of Gods elect? It is God that juſtifyeth: Who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt that died, yea rather that is riſen again;
<pb n="423" facs="tcp:63712:215"/>who is even at the right hand of God, who alſo maketh interceſſion for us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Here then is the great <hi>Power</hi> of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour's <hi>Reſurrection</hi> to make us good. Chriſt being riſen from the dead, hath all Power given him both in Heaven and in Earth. <hi>God,</hi> as St. <hi>Paul</hi> expreſſeth it, <hi>hath put all things under his feet, and hath given him to be head over all things to the Church,</hi> Eph. 1.22. Now in the fullneſs of that Power that he is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with; as he doth on one hand, with never-failing efficacy make continual Interceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for his Church and every Member of it: So he doth on the other hand, out of the fulneſs of that Power, derive and communicate ſo much Strength and Grace and Aſſiſtance of the Divine Spirit to all Chriſtians; that if they make a good uſe of it, they ſhall not fail to perform all thoſe Conditions of <hi>Faith</hi> and <hi>Repentance</hi> and a <hi>Holy Life,</hi> that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them, in order to their being made actual partakers of all thoſe unſpeakable Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits, which he purchaſed for Mankind by his Death and Sufferings.</p>
               <p>Chriſt by his Reſurrection is become both our <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> and our <hi>King;</hi> both our <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate</hi> and our <hi>Lord.</hi> By that Power which he then obtained, as our <hi>Prieſt</hi> and <hi>Advocate</hi> he doth with Authority recommend us and all our concernments to his Father. As our <hi>King</hi> and <hi>Lord,</hi> he rules and governs us; he takes care of us; he provides for us; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes
<pb n="424" facs="tcp:63712:216"/>the inſults of his and our Enemies, and defeats all their attempts againſt us; And, laſtly, he ſupplies us from time to time with ſuch a meaſure of Grace and Strength, and influence of his Divine Spirit, as he ſees is needful or proper for our Condition.</p>
               <p>If all this now, that I have ſaid, be the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of our Saviour's Reſurrection, as it cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly is: Muſt we not needs own that there is a mighty Power in it for the making us good? What can any man among us, that profeſſeth to believe that Jeſus was raiſed from the dead, ſay for himſelf, if he leads a wicked Life? What Apology can he make for the continuance in his ſins? Will he ſay that the Temptations to ſin are too ſtrong for him; that he wants Grace, and Strength to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his evil Habits; and that through the corruption of his Nature he muſt of neceſſity remain a ſlave all his days to his Paſſions and Appetites whether he will or no? Why, in ſaying this, he forgets that Chriſt is riſen from the dead. For if he did remember that, he would remember alſo, that there is a <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Power,</hi> above that of corrupt <hi>Nature,</hi> which he, as a Chriſtian, may eaſily come by, if he ſeriouſly ſeek after it: Namely, The Grace and Strength of the Holy Spirit of God, which I have been ſpeaking of, which Chriſt upon his Reſurrection obtained the diſpoſal of; and which he never fails to ſend down upon every Soul that heartily prays for
<pb n="425" facs="tcp:63712:216"/>it; and when ever he gives it, he gives it in ſuch meaſures, that a man muſt certainly, by the influence thereof, overcome all his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil and corrupt Affections; or if he do not, it ſhall be entirely his own fault.</p>
               <p>O, what a mighty Comfort and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ought this to be to all thoſe that hearti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſire and endeavour to be good! All ſuch may with boldneſs approach to the Throne of Grace, and confidently open their wants, not doubting of ſuch Relief as is moſt conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient for them. <hi>Our Saviour is riſen,</hi> and ſits at the Right hand of God. He that loved us ſo dearly as to die for us, is now entred into his Kingdom, and is able to grant us whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever we ask.</p>
               <p>Do we find our ſelves burdened with our ſins? Do we want ſtrength to reſiſt Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and to maſter our ſtrong Corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons? <hi>Our Saviour is riſen,</hi> and now <hi>ever liveth to make interceſſion for us.</hi> Let us fly to him for ſuccour, let us beg a portion of that Grace and Holy Spirit he hath purchaſed for us. We may reſt ſatisfied he will hear our Prayers, and derive ſuch vigour and influence upon our Souls, that we ſhall in due time, by the means thereof, vanquiſh and triumph over every thing that oppoſeth us.</p>
               <p>We cannot in any wiſe doubt of his <hi>Power,</hi> for God by raiſing him from the dead hath
<pb n="426" facs="tcp:63712:217"/>made him both King and Prieſt, hath exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to the higheſt Authority and Digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty both in Heaven and Earth. We cannot doubt of his <hi>good will,</hi> for he that underwent ſo many Difficulties and Agonies for us in the days of his Fleſh, cannot forget thoſe whom he hath ranſomed with ſo great a price, nor ſuffer that Power which God hath given him, to lie by him unimploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>To conclude, Let us not faint; Let not our hearts be troubled; Let us not deſpair of any thing. <hi>Our Saviour is riſen.</hi> Our High-prieſt is entred within the vail, hath taken poſſeſſion of the higheſt Heaven, where he continually makes interceſſion for us. Such a High-prieſt as is kind and compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate, and tender-hearted; that knoweth our frame, and remembreth that we are but duſt; that pities our weakneſſes, and is ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the difficulties we have to conflict with, as having himſelf had ſufficient experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of them. And withal, ſuch a High-prieſt as is <hi>able to ſave to the uttermoſt all thoſe that come unto God through him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus have I given ſome account of the Virtue of our Saviour's <hi>Reſurrection,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the making us ſincerely Good. What remains? But that, as we ſhould heartily thank God for theſe Benefits of it; ſo we
<pb n="427" facs="tcp:63712:217"/>ſhould eſpecially endeavour to be partakers of them; not contenting our ſelves with a notional, ineffectual Faith, but labouring with St. <hi>Paul</hi> experimentally to <hi>know</hi> Chriſt Jeſus, <hi>and the Power of his Reſurrection.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now the God of peace that brought again from the dead our Lord Jeſus that great ſhepherd of the ſheep, through the blood of the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Covenant; make you perfect in every good work, to do his will, working in you that which is well pleaſing in his ſight, through Jeſus Christ, to whom be glory for ever and ever,</hi> Amen.</p>

               <p>THat is to ſay, it ought to be Matter of exceeding Joy to all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the World, that amidſt all the uncertainties, and Hazards, and Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of Fortunes, which they here find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves expoſed to, there is One Above that go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns all.</p>
               <pb n="430" facs="tcp:63712:219"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>GOD</hi> that made the World is the <hi>King</hi> of it. All the Beings of the Univerſe, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, Men, and Devils, with all the other Animate or Inanimate things in Heaven and Earth, as they are His <hi>Creatures,</hi> ſo are they truly and properly His <hi>Subjects,</hi> and act en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely in ſubordination to Him, as Miniſters and Inſtruments do under the Guidance of the Principal Agent.</p>
               <p>GOD doth as truly Reign in the World, as any King does in his Kingdom: He doth as truly order the Affairs of it, as any Maſter doth thoſe of his own Family. Nay, a Man's own Thoughts and Actions are not by a thouſand times ſo much attended by himſelf, are not ſo much his Care, as the Affairs of the Univerſe are attended by, and are the Care of God Almighty.</p>
               <p>This is the notion of the <hi>Lord</hi>'s being <hi>King;</hi> and, Do you not think it ought to be matter of <hi>Rejoycing</hi> to all Reaſonable Creatures?</p>
               <p>O Lord! what a gloomy diſmal <hi>Scene</hi> of things do they preſent us with, that give o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Accounts of theſe matters?</p>
               <p>To baniſh God's Providence and Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment out of the World, is to baniſh all Joy, all Peace, all Hope, all Comfort for ever, from all thoſe that have the power of Think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>A Brute indeed is not much concern'd how Matters are order'd: An <hi>Ox</hi> may grow fat in his <hi>Stall,</hi> and a <hi>Colt</hi> frisk in his <hi>Pasture,</hi>
                  <pb n="431" facs="tcp:63712:219"/>let the <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> of the Government of the World be what it will. But to one that is made with a Faculty of Reaſoning, that has <hi>Hopes</hi> and <hi>Fears,</hi> and can reflect on what is paſt, and hath a proſpect of what is future; what black and melancholy Apprehenſions muſt it cauſe in ſuch a one, to ſuppoſe that no care is taken of Human Affairs; but that we ſail in the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous <hi>Ocean</hi> of this World, every minute in danger of <hi>Rocks</hi> and <hi>Quickſands,</hi> without any <hi>Pilot</hi> to ſteer us?</p>
               <p>Take what <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> you will; either, That there is no God, but that all things comes to paſs by <hi>Chance,</hi> or inevitable <hi>Neceſſity;</hi> Or, That there is a God, but that God having once put things into this Frame, never meant to trouble himſelf more about them, but left them to ſhift for themſelves, <hi>Natural E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents</hi> falling out from neceſſary Cauſes, and <hi>Civil Aſſairs</hi> being left to Mankind, who are to ſhuffle and divide the World among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as well as they can: I ſay, proceed which way you will, if you exclude God Almighty's <hi>Government,</hi> you make this World ſo dark and miſerable a place, that no ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, conſidering man can tolerably enjoy him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in it.</p>
               <p>For here, upon the former ſuppoſition, you are left without Counſel or Advice. You have nothing to propoſe, nothing to deſign in the courſe of your Lives. It is all one how you behave your ſelves, whether
<pb n="432" facs="tcp:63712:220"/>honeſtly or wickedly; whether you mind your Buſineſs, or mind it not, for the Even will be the ſame. You are obliged to no body for any Benefits; you can complain of no body for any ill uſage. If you be in ill circumſtances, you have none to apply to for Remedy; and if you be in good ones, you may be ſtript of them without Remedy the next moment: for <hi>all things</hi> are carried on by a whirl of Fate.</p>
               <p>And you are not much better'd by the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>Hypotheſis,</hi> That God hath truſted the Government of the World with Mankind, who are endowed with Reaſon and Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
               <p>For, if we conſider how Mankind do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſe their Reaſons, it is as good, if not better, to be expoſed to the Hazards of Chance or Neceſſity, as to be ſubject to their Wills.</p>
               <p>The truth of it is, if this <hi>Syſteme</hi> of the World be well conſider'd, it will appear a more uncomfortable one than the other; for it doth not remove from us the <hi>Iron Bands</hi> of <hi>Fate,</hi> we are ſtill under that Yoke as much as we were before. Yet beſides theſe, it puts upon us another Yoke, the <hi>arbitrary Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures</hi> of thoſe of our own kind, which, if they be not govern'd by Reaſon, are ten times more unſupportable than the other.</p>
               <p>We are by this <hi>Hypotheſis</hi> as much expoſed to <hi>Natural Evils</hi> as we were before, and
<pb n="433" facs="tcp:63712:220"/>there is no help for them; but over and above, we muſt bear the Indignities and Inſolences, the Ravages and Cruelty of every one that is ſtronger than our ſelves, and hath the will to oppreſs us.</p>
               <p>O hard Lot of Mankind, if this was their Conſtitution! better by far were it for them to be Brutes, and think of nothing; than to be Men, upon ſuch Terms as theſe.</p>
               <p>Happy therefore are the <hi>Inhabitants</hi> of the Earth, happy are the remoteſt <hi>Iſles</hi> thereof, that there is a <hi>King</hi> that reigns both over <hi>Fate</hi> and <hi>Men.</hi> Happy are we, that there is a wiſe and intelligent <hi>Being,</hi> that ſuperintends all our Affairs, and ſo governs both the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of <hi>Nature,</hi> and the Powers of <hi>Mankind;</hi> that nothing can be done by either of them, but what is deſigned by, and purſuant to his Counſels.</p>
               <p>Upon this Suppoſition we may live like <hi>Men,</hi> and enjoy our ſelves with ſome Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in this World. We may propoſe Ends and Deſigns to our ſelves, and hope that with our <hi>diligence</hi> and <hi>good management</hi> they may take effect.</p>
               <p>Upon this Suppoſition we may and ought to look upon all our good Succeſſes, as the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of God to us, and particularly that which we are this day met together to thank Him for; I mean, the wonderful <hi>Preſervation</hi> of His <hi>Majeſty</hi> from all the Dangers to which
<pb n="434" facs="tcp:63712:221"/>he hath ſo often been expoſed, and his ſafe <hi>Return</hi> to us.</p>
               <p>Upon this Suppoſition we may hope, that tho' all things have not ſucceeded according to our Wiſhes, yet in due time they may, ſince the <hi>King</hi> of the <hi>World</hi> hath, by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and unexpected Deliverances he hath wrought for us, and the ſtrange unuſual Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidences that have attended our <hi>King,</hi> given us ſome Encouragement to believe (provided we do our parts towards it) that He hath reſerv'd <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s</hi> for better Times, and <hi>Him</hi> for the executing thoſe <hi>Glorious Deſigns,</hi> which Good Men hope will at laſt be accompliſh'd in the World.</p>
               <p>Laſtly, Upon this Suppoſition, every Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt Man will find reaſon enough both to bear contentedly whatever uneaſie Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances he lyes under, and to truſt in God's Mercy for the removal of them; and in the mean time to poſſeſs his own Soul in a cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful dependance on God's Providence, and a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Thankfulneſs for all the innumerable Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings he hath receiv'd, and doth daily receive from his Hands. And therefore, ſince <hi>the Lord is King let the earth be glad: yea, let the multitude of the iſles be glad thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, That the Lord is really thus the <hi>King</hi> of the World, there are all the Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to perſwade us that can be deſir'd:</p>
               <p>It is the Voice of <hi>Reaſon:</hi> It is the Voice of all <hi>Mankind:</hi> It is the Voice of <hi>GOD</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="435" facs="tcp:63712:221"/>both in His <hi>Works,</hi> and in His <hi>Word.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Give me leave to give you a <hi>Specimen</hi> in all theſe ways of <hi>Arguing,</hi> and but a <hi>Specimen,</hi> becauſe it would be rather the Work of a <hi>Book</hi> than of a <hi>Sermon</hi> to dilate upon theſe matters.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> I ſay, <hi>Reaſon</hi> tells us it muſt be thus. For admitting that the World did not make it ſelf, but was made by God; it will follow, that the ſame God that made it muſt ſtill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern it: For, the ſame Ends, and Deſigns, and Motives (whatever they were) that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced God to make the World at firſt, will oblige Him for ever to take care of it and look after it. Unleſs we ſuppoſe God to contrive an act as uncertainly and unſtedily, and with the ſame inconſtancy and levity of Mind that ſome of <hi>us Mortals</hi> here upon Earth do.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It is the Voice of all <hi>Mankind.</hi> For, otherwiſe how comes it to paſs, that among all Nations, and in all Ages, there has been ſome <hi>Religion</hi> or other practiſed.</p>
               <p>I pray, what is the meaning of worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing God, of putting up Prayers and Supplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to Him for the things we need; of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning Thanks for the Benefits we have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; of appointing Religious Rites and Methods for the expiation of Guilt, or the averting of impendent Calamities (all which things have been practiſed in all Nations, from the beginning of the World to this day)? I ſay, what is the meaning of all this, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs
<pb n="436" facs="tcp:63712:222"/>it was hereby meant to be ſignified, That there is a God which doth concern himſelf in the Affairs of <hi>Mankind,</hi> and who doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe, Good or Evil, to them, as they well, or ill, behave themſelves towards him?</p>
               <p>The Truth is, To ſay, that God doth not govern the World, is to ſay, that all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion is a Cheat; and, that all Mankind, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a few debauch'd <hi>Wits</hi> in the more <hi>polite Countries,</hi> and a few <hi>Brutes</hi> in the very <hi>bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barous</hi> ones, (who are of no Religion at all) have been, and are a company of credulous Fools. For this is certain, whatever Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment either <hi>Jew,</hi> or <hi>Turk,</hi> or <hi>Pagan,</hi> or <hi>Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian,</hi> can ſuggeſt to himſelf for the convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him, that it is his Concernment, or his Duty, to worſhip God, or to be of any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion at all, nay, or to make any conſcience of any Action he does; I ſay, all theſe Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments do not only prove, but ſuppoſe, that God both knows and orders the Affairs of the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It may likewiſe be as ſtrongly proved from <hi>Effects;</hi> from the tracks and footſteps of a Divine over-ruling Providence, which are to be ſeen in the <hi>Events</hi> that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen in the World, which is what I call the <hi>Voice of God in his Works.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are indeed ſo many and ſo viſible, that whoſoever hath either read Hiſtory, or hath made Obſervations, muſt needs have taken notice of them.</p>
               <pb n="437" facs="tcp:63712:222"/>
               <p>If ever there were any extraordinary <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances</hi> vouchſafed to Kingdoms, or Cities, or particular Perſons; or ever any remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Judgments</hi> inflicted upon any of theſe, which ſo carried the <hi>Marks</hi> and <hi>Signatures</hi> of God's Hand in them, that the One could not in reaſon but be <hi>attributed</hi> to the Care that he had, that <hi>Religion</hi> or <hi>Innocence</hi> ſhould not be oppreſſed; and the Other muſt in reaſon be interpreted as a Divine Vengeance, that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued the <hi>Guilty</hi> for <hi>their Crimes:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If ever there were any <hi>Prophecies</hi> that did punctually foretell a <hi>Particular Event</hi> that came not to paſs till many Years after, and ſuch an Event as was perfectly contingent, and depended upon the <hi>Wills of Men:</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If ever there were any <hi>Notices</hi> given of <hi>Approaching Calamities,</hi> by Voices from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, by ſtrange Appearances in the Air, and ſuch other like Preſages, not naturally to be accounted for:</p>
               <p>If ever there were any <hi>Apparitions,</hi> any <hi>Witchcraft,</hi> any effects of a <hi>Diabolical Power,</hi> by which it may appear, that there are a ſort of Inviſible Beings in the World, which do bear ill will to Mankind, but yet are ſo curbed, that they cannot do all the Miſchief they would:</p>
               <p>If ever there were any <hi>Miracles</hi> wrought either by <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>Prophets,</hi> or by <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> and his <hi>Apoſtles,</hi> for the confirmation of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> or the <hi>Chriſtian</hi> Religion:</p>
               <pb n="438" facs="tcp:63712:223"/>
               <p>Laſtly, If ever any Good Man did ever receive any Bleſſing, or avoid any Misfortune, which he might rationally look upon as an Anſwer to the Fervent Prayers that he had put up to God, or others had put up for him:</p>
               <p>I ſay, If any of theſe things that I have now named be true (as all Hiſtories give us a World of Inſtances of the truth of <hi>all</hi> of them, and as for <hi>ſome</hi> of them, I do not doubt but they fall within the compaſs of our own Obſervation and Experience.) I ſay, if any of theſe things be true, then have we a convincing Proof, that there is a Power that doth interpoſe in the Affairs of the World, ſuperiour both to that of Nature, and to that of Mankind, and which moderates <hi>all things,</hi> according as it ſeems good unto him.</p>
               <p>But in truth, we need not go to <hi>ſupernatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Events,</hi> or to <hi>particular Providences</hi> for the Truth of this: For, in my Opinion, the daily effects that every one of us ſees and feels; the very Subſiſtence of the World for ſo many Ages, in that regular frame that it was at firſt; and the fair Treatment and Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement (how unequally ſoever things ſeem to be diſtributed) which vertuous and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious men have always found in it, and do yet find, notwithſtanding that far the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt number of men are of another ſtamp: I ſay, theſe very things ſeem an Argument be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond
<pb n="439" facs="tcp:63712:223"/>exception, That there is a God that preſides over us, and takes care of us.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Fourthly</hi> and laſtly, God has yet given us a further Proof of this, by his own many Authentick Declarations in the Holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures (which we call his <hi>Word.</hi>)</p>
               <p>One of the main buſineſſes of which is,<note place="margin">Dan. 4.17.</note> to aſſure us, That <hi>He rules in the kingdoms of men,</hi> and diſpoſeth of all their Affairs.</p>
               <p>There He is ſet forth as the Author of all E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents,<note place="margin">Amos. 3.6.</note> both good and bad; ſo that <hi>no evil happens in a City, but the Lord doth it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There He is repreſented as the <hi>ſearcher of all hearts,</hi> the Judge of all mens Deſigns and Actions, the Avenger of all Evil Practices, and the Refuge of all Good Men.</p>
               <p>There we are told, that <hi>He is the God of of Battles,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 33.16.</note> and that <hi>no King is ſaved by the multitude of his Armies, nor any mighty Man delivered by his own ſtrength: but Salvation is from the Lord.</hi> And ſo are Diſappointments alſo.</p>

<pb n="440" facs="tcp:63712:224"/>done in vain; but all Events are in purſuance of a Deſign.</p>
               <p>Nay, not ſo much as the Event of caſting a Lot (which ſeems the moſt fortuitous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingent thing in the whole World) is left at random: For even in that Caſe <hi>the diſpoſal of the Lot</hi> (as <hi>Solomon</hi> tells us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.33.) <hi>is from the Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>All this is not only the Doctrine, but in a great meaſure the very Language and Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of thoſe Holy Books. And, what can we deſire more? Or, what words can we invent that ſhall declare more fully the thing we are ſpeaking of?</p>
               <p>None can that I know of, except perhaps thoſe of our Saviour, with which I ſhall ſhut up this point.<note place="margin">Matt. 10.29.</note> 
                  <hi>Fear not,</hi> (ſaith he to his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples) <hi>Are not two ſparrows ſold for a farthing? yet not one of them falls to the ground without the will of your Father. Nay, I ſay unto you, the very hairs of your head are all numbered.</hi> O wonderful this! what! God Almighty num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber the very Hairs of our Heads! <hi>Lord, what is man, that thou ſhouldſt have ſuch reſpect un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him,</hi> and do that for him which even the <hi>niceſt</hi> and moſt <hi>delicate</hi> of Men never yet did for themſelves? But thus art thou pleaſed to expreſs thy particular regard to the Sons of Men. Thus art thou pleaſed to let us ſee, that none of us are ſo inconſiderable, but that we are within the Verge of thy Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and Objects of thy Care. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="441" facs="tcp:63712:224"/>much more are <hi>Cities,</hi> and <hi>States,</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms</hi> ſo, wherein the Fortunes of ſo many Individuals are wrapt up.</p>
               <p>O, bleſſed be God for his Love to Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind! O, for ever adored be his Name for thus humbling himſelf to take notice of us and our Affairs, and likewiſe for giving us ſuch abundant Aſſurance that he doth ſo! Since therefore we have ſuch mighty Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of all ſorts, that <hi>the Lord is King, let the Earth be glad: yea, let the multitudes of the iſles be glad thereof.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And we ſhall ſtill ſee greater reaſon thus to be <hi>glad,</hi> if we conſider a little more par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly the <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Meaſures</hi> by which God adminiſters the Affairs of his <hi>Kingdom:</hi> Which are not, as too often happens in <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> Governments, Arbitrary <hi>Will</hi> or <hi>Humour,</hi> but perfect <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Tho' it be true what the Pſalmiſt ſaith,<note place="margin">Pſal. 135.6.</note> That <hi>Whatſoever the Lord pleaſeth, that doth he in Heaven and in Earth, and in the Sea and all deep places:</hi> Yet it is as true, that the Lord will never be pleaſed to do any thing, either in Heaven or in Earth, but what is ſuggeſted by infinite <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> and in ſuch ways as are the Reſult of Infinite <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> For as the ſame <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> tells us,<note place="margin">Pſal. 33.5</note> 
                  <hi>He loveth righteouſneſs and judgment; the earth is full of the goodneſs of the Lord. He is holy in all his ways,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſal. 145.17, 9.</note> 
                  <hi>and righteous in all his doings: and his tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are over all his works.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="442" facs="tcp:63712:225"/>
               <p>To ſay, That God deals <hi>arbitrarily</hi> with a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of his Creatures; or, that He diſpenſeth <hi>Good</hi> or <hi>Evil</hi> to them meerly <hi>becauſe He will,</hi> without any other Reaſon, is in truth to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parage His Nature, and gives us ſuch a no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Him, as we have perhaps of ſome of the <hi>Great Monarchs</hi> of the World, but whom we are far from eſteeming the <hi>Beſt Men.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>No certainly, if we Mankind find in our ſelves, that the wiſer and better we grow, the leſs are we led by <hi>Humour</hi> and <hi>Will,</hi> and the more do we ſhake off our Indifferency to <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil,</hi> and the more ſteadily do we cleave to the eternal Laws of <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> in all our Actions: We may be ſure that <hi>God,</hi> who is <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Juſtice,</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs</hi> it ſelf, can never in any of his Actions or Dealings with his Creatures, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from theſe Principles.</p>
               <p>The true Scheme of God Almighty's Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is plainly this.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Infinite Mind</hi> clearly underſtood all the <hi>Poſſibilities</hi> of things long before they were in <hi>actual being.</hi> He knew what things were poſſible to be; and how they would act if they were put into being; and what the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents of all their Actings would be.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Infinite Goodneſs</hi> moved him to put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>actual being</hi> every thing that he ſaw was <hi>Good</hi> to <hi>Be;</hi> and to give them all thoſe <hi>pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Action</hi> that they have; and withal, to look after them ſo, as that both they and all
<pb n="443" facs="tcp:63712:225"/>their Motions and Actions ſhould at laſt be to the Praiſe and Glory of the ſame <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> that firſt enclined him to create them.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Infinite Wiſdom</hi> contrived the Methods in which all this ſhould be brought to paſs, and ſo laid the <hi>Scheme</hi> and <hi>Platform</hi> of things, that nothing could happen in the whole Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, from the beginning of the World to the end thereof, (tho' it was in it ſelf never ſo bad, never ſo miſchievous) but what both might and ſhould be ſo ordered, as to be ſubſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to that end.</p>
               <p>And laſtly, The <hi>Scheme</hi> of Things being thus laid, His <hi>Infinite Power</hi> firſt produced <hi>All things,</hi> and ſtill upholds <hi>All things,</hi> and from time to time, in their ſeveral ſeaſons, actually brings to paſs <hi>every thing,</hi> according to the Determinations of his eternal <hi>Wiſdom.</hi> And tho' it doth it in ways ſecret to us, yet it doth it certainly and ſurely, and withal, moſt eaſily and gently, with the leaſt vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to the eſtabliſh'd <hi>Laws</hi> of <hi>Nature,</hi> and without any force at all upon the <hi>Free Wills</hi> of <hi>Intelligent Beings.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This I ſay, is the Account that both <hi>Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> and <hi>Scripture</hi> give us of God's Making and Governing the World. Infinite <hi>Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> is the Foundation of <hi>All.</hi> Infinite <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> is the Author and Mover of <hi>All.</hi> Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite <hi>Wiſdom</hi> is the Contriver and Director of <hi>All.</hi> And Infinite <hi>Power</hi> executes <hi>All.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Admit now theſe Principles, and ſee what will follow from them.</p>
               <pb n="244" facs="tcp:63712:226"/>
               <p>It will follow from hence, in the <hi>firſt</hi> place, that every Event that happens in the World, <hi>is beautiful in its ſeaſon;</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> expreſſes it. That is to ſay, How unaccountable ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it may appear to us, yet there is a good Reaſon to be given, both why it happens at all, and likewiſe why it happens at that <hi>time,</hi> and with thoſe <hi>circumſtances</hi> that it doth. It helps to adorn the Great <hi>Drama</hi> and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivance of God's Providence, and miniſters to excellent Ends, tho' we poor Creatures do little apprehend how it makes for them. As indeed it is impoſſible we ſhould, unleſs we had the whole <hi>Comprehenſion</hi> of <hi>Things</hi> in our Minds, and ſaw the <hi>entire Scheme</hi> of God's Government, from the beginning to the end. This muſt needs be ſo, if we be Govern'd by <hi>Infinite Wiſdom.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> It follows from hence, that both <hi>Good</hi> and <hi>Evil</hi> are meaſured to Mankind ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their reſpective Capacities. If we be fit for Good, Good will come. If we deſerve Puniſhment, we muſt expect that likewiſe. For, <hi>All God's ways are equal,</hi> tho' <hi>Ours be unequal.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And therefore it is the moſt unreaſonable thing in the World to impute our Succeſſes, whether they be Good or Bad, ſo wholly to the <hi>immediate Hands</hi> that managed our Affairs, as not in the firſt place to take notice of the <hi>Hand</hi> of <hi>God</hi> in them.</p>
               <pb n="445" facs="tcp:63712:226"/>
               <p>There is a Divine Power that governs all theſe matters. And tho' it be true, that no Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, no ill Succeſs ever happens, but there is a <hi>Human</hi> Reaſon to be given for it; and it may be found out upon what occaſion, or by what neglect, or thro' what ill management that Misfortune happened: Yet it is as true, that if thoſe that managed for us had the Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the Conduct, and the Strength of the very Angels of God, yet their Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours would not be effectual, for the making us happy, unleſs we our ſelves were in a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of being ſo, by being proper Objects of God's Mercy and Favour. This muſt likewiſe be true, if perfect <hi>Juſtice</hi> govern the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It follows from hence, that even the ſeverer Diſpenſations of God's Providence toward us; the things we complain of, and are uneaſie under; our very <hi>Calamities,</hi> and <hi>Misfortunes,</hi> and <hi>Diſappointments;</hi> even theſe are the effects of <hi>God's Kindneſs,</hi> tho' at the ſame time they may be likewiſe Inſtances of His <hi>Juſtice.</hi> That is to ſay, they are meant really for our <hi>Good,</hi> and will prove ſo, if we make that uſe of them we ſhould do.</p>
               <p>The very Nature of God is to do all <hi>Good,</hi> at all <hi>Times,</hi> to all his <hi>Creatures.</hi> For, He had no other End in making them, nor has he any other End in looking after them. But God cannot do good to All in the ſame way. <hi>Correction,</hi> and <hi>Chaſtiſement,</hi> and <hi>Puniſhment</hi>
                  <pb n="446" facs="tcp:63712:227"/>is in ſome caſes more expedient for the bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing People to Rights, and promoting their true Intereſts, than the giving them all that their own Hearts can wiſh. In ſuch caſes therefore God muſt deal with his Creatures as every wiſe Parent deals with his Children. And tho' <hi>theſe Chaſtiſements</hi> (as the Apoſtle tells us) <hi>are not joyous, but grievous,</hi> yet are they deſign'd for <hi>the bringing forth the peaceable fruits of righteouſneſs in all them that are exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed thereby.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The truth is, we do not know what is good for our ſelves. We often wiſh for things, that perhaps, if our wiſhes were granted, would undo us. But our Happineſs is, that God <hi>knows</hi> all, and ſo <hi>tempers</hi> all, that all Events, even thoſe that we are apt to look upon as the greateſt Judgments, ſhall at laſt appear more viſibly to have been the wiſeſt methods that could poſſibly have been contrived for the doing the <hi>Greateſt Good</hi> to us. And if they do not ſucceed accordingly, it will be our own fault.</p>
               <p>This muſt likewiſe needs be true, if per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect <hi>Goodneſs</hi> govern All: For even <hi>Juſtice</hi> it ſelf is but a different way of expreſſing <hi>Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> And all that, which we call <hi>Judgment</hi> and <hi>Vengeance,</hi> is unaccountable, unleſs it ſerve for the <hi>doing Good</hi> to the World.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Fourthly,</hi> and Laſtly; From hence it fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, that all Events whatſoever, that ever did, or do, or ſhall happen in the World,
<pb n="447" facs="tcp:63712:227"/>either with reſpect to Nations, and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, or with reſpect to particular Perſons, are really the <hi>Beſt</hi> that could, or can hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen. And if things were ordered otherwiſe, it would not be ſo <hi>well.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>A ſtrange <hi>Paradox</hi> you will ſay this is; that not only the <hi>Miſchiefs</hi> and <hi>Calamities</hi> that fall upon Mankind, but even their <hi>Faults</hi> and <hi>Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>managements,</hi> nay, their very <hi>Sins and Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſſes,</hi> ſhould be for the beſt. But really ſo it is, and ſo it muſt be, if both infinite <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>Power</hi> govern the World.</p>
               <p>Not, but that a particular man's <hi>Sins</hi> may be the occaſion of his <hi>Ruin,</hi> nay, and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly <hi>will</hi> be ſo, if he perſiſt in them.</p>
               <p>And likewiſe the Faults of a <hi>People</hi> may, and will have ſuch an ill influence upon the <hi>Community,</hi> as if they be not amended, the Deſolation of the Nation may at <hi>laſt</hi> enſue thereupon.</p>
               <p>But ſtill, tho' every thing that happens do not prove for the <hi>Good</hi> of that particular <hi>Perſon,</hi> or that particular <hi>People,</hi> that is immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly concerned in the Event; yet it will cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly prove for the <hi>General <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Good.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So that, take all the whole <hi>Series</hi> of Events together, that have, or ſhall come to paſs all the World over, we may undoubtedly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that All things have been as well ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged, as it is poſſible they could be, and will be ſo to the end of the World. And
<pb n="448" facs="tcp:63712:228"/>this we our ſelves ſhall be ſatisfied of, when we come to be in a condition of making a juſt eſtimate of things.</p>
               <p>For indeed, to ſuppoſe otherwiſe, is to ſay, either that <hi>Infinite Wiſdom</hi> doth not act ſo <hi>wiſely</hi> as it might do; or, that <hi>Perfect Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> might <hi>do</hi> more <hi>Good</hi> than it does do; or, laſtly, that <hi>Omnipotent Power</hi> cannot do every thing that is <hi>poſſible.</hi> All which Suppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are plainly abſurd and contradictious.</p>
               <p>And now, if all theſe things be true (as they certainly are) how <hi>natural</hi> is the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of my Text? Since <hi>God</hi> is the <hi>King</hi> of all the World, and ſuch a <hi>King</hi> likewiſe, that the <hi>Meaſures</hi> of his Government are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> and <hi>Righteouſneſs;</hi> what have all Mankind to do, eſpecially <hi>Good Men,</hi> but to <hi>Rejoyce and be glad?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi>'s Inference from this Doctrine. And this is the preſent Buſineſs of the Day: And therefore let us all practiſe accordingly. That is the only <hi>Application</hi> I deſire to make of what hath been ſaid.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Two</hi> ways we ought to expreſs our <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt,</hi> In a hearty ſenſe of all God's <hi>paſt</hi> and <hi>preſent Mercies</hi> to us, and an actual giving Him our Thanks for the ſame.</p>
               <pb n="449" facs="tcp:63712:228"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> In a chearful dependance upon Him for his <hi>Future</hi> Bleſſings. Give me leave to ſpeak a little to theſe two Points, and I have done.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Let us be heartily ſenſible of All God's <hi>Kindneſs</hi> to us, both <hi>past</hi> and <hi>preſent,</hi> and unfeignedly thank Him for the ſame.</p>
               <p>It is very remarkable, that not only <hi>David,</hi> but the <hi>Prophets</hi> likewiſe, when they are treating of God's <hi>Kingdom,</hi> call upon the <hi>Iſles</hi> in a particular manner to take notice of it; [See <hi>Iſa.</hi> xxiv. 15. xlii. 4, 10, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>] as here in my Text, <hi>Let the multitudes of the Iſles be glad thereof:</hi> As if the <hi>Iſles</hi> in a more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular manner were to have a ſhare in the Bleſſings of his Government. And, no doubt, it was ſo intended, and accordingly it hath ſo come to paſs. For, it is the <hi>Iſles of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> by which Name the Scripture expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth thoſe Countries that were at the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt diſtance from the <hi>Continent</hi> of <hi>Judea;</hi> I ſay, it is theſe <hi>Iſles,</hi> which now at this day (God's ancient People the <hi>Jews</hi> being for their <hi>Infidelity</hi> long ago rejected) are the principal Seat of his <hi>Church</hi> and <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and to which He vouchſafeth the Light of his Goſpel, and the Means of Salvation; ſo true is God to all his Promiſes.</p>
               <p>But now, of all the <hi>Iſles of the Gentiles,</hi> if any one above the reſt hath felt the benign
<pb n="450" facs="tcp:63712:229"/>and gracious Influences of the <hi>LORD</hi>'s be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our <hi>King,</hi> certainly <hi>Ours</hi> is that <hi>Iſland.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>How wonderfully bountiful hath God been to us in a continued ſucceſſion of <hi>Publick Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings,</hi> even from the firſt beginning of Time, that we have had any Memorials of Events among us?</p>
               <p>We had the Happineſs to be early made a <hi>Province</hi> of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, and by that means were trained up to <hi>Civility,</hi> and <hi>Arts,</hi> and <hi>Good Manners.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That made way for the greateſt Bleſſing that Heaven could beſtow upon us, even the receiving <hi>Chriſtianity:</hi> And that Bleſſing we had with the moſt early, being the firſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the Nations that embraced it.</p>
               <p>When through the juſt Judgment of God, <hi>Barbariſm</hi> and <hi>Ignorance</hi> overſpread the face of <hi>Europe,</hi> and by the occaſion thereof <hi>Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition</hi> and <hi>Idolatry</hi> made its way, and all the <hi>Weſtern</hi> Kingdoms gave up their Power to a Foreign Uſurper; even then this <hi>Iſland</hi> made the longeſt ſtand; nay, and was never ſo perfectly ſubdued, but that <hi>Popery</hi> was here a different thing, from what it was in the <hi>Southern</hi> Climates.</p>
               <p>When the happy time came, that God thought fit to ſet on foot the <hi>Reformation,</hi> (having firſt made way for it, by the reſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring of <hi>Learning</hi>) ſuch was His particular Care of us, that this was one of the <hi>first</hi> Kingdoms that was brought over to it.</p>
               <pb n="451" facs="tcp:63712:229"/>
               <p>And we have this Advantage above all o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Reformed Churches,</hi> that as our <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> was regularly made, and by juſt Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſo it was made moſt agreeably to the Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of the Primitive Churches of Chriſt.</p>
               <p>And, God be thanked, according to the goodneſs of it, ſuch hath been its Succeſs e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſince; for we have all-along, from that time to this, (except the interruption of a few Years in the late Times) ſerved God in Peace and Happineſs, under the ſame Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment. And we truſt we ſhall do ſo to the end of the World.</p>
               <p>Many indeed have been the Oppoſitions and Diſturbances, that have been given us by our Adverſaries, both at home and abroad; but as manifold likewiſe have been our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverances, and that in a moſt wonderful manner.</p>
               <p>I need not mention them, for they are known to us all.</p>
               <p>How many <hi>Secret</hi> Conſpiracies againſt our <hi>Proteſtant Kings</hi> and <hi>Queens,</hi> hath <hi>God Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty</hi>'s Mercy detected and defeated?</p>
               <p>How many <hi>Open</hi> Attempts againſt our <hi>Laws,</hi> and againſt our <hi>Religion,</hi> hath He by ſtrange Providences brought to nought?</p>
               <p>More than once hath He by wonderful methods preſerved us, when we gave up our <hi>Church</hi> and our <hi>Liberties</hi> in a manner as loſt, and that in ſo eaſie and quiet a way, that
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:63712:230"/>there was no concuſſion of the Nation fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed thereupon.</p>
               <p>Are not theſe <hi>Extraordinary Inſtances</hi> of God's Kindneſs to a People? And, ought not we, who have receiv'd, and do yet enjoy the <hi>Benefit</hi> and the <hi>Comfort</hi> of them, to remember them with Thankfulneſs all the Days of our Life?</p>
               <p>But ſome of us, perhaps, are not now in a <hi>Humour</hi> to think of theſe things; our pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Circumſtances fill our Minds, and <hi>Thoſe</hi> are difficult enough. Let our <hi>past</hi> Deliveran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces have been what they will, yet we are ſure we are now in a Hazardous Condition, notwithſtanding all the Prayers we have put up for better Succeſſes.</p>
               <p>That is too true: And I pray God make us all ſenſible of it; and eſpecially make us ſenſible of the things that have cauſed it, namely, our Ingratitude for God's former Mercies; our Lewdneſs and Debauchery; the Spirit of Atheiſm and Profaneneſs, and Irreligion, that ſtill reigns among us as much as ever; and above all, our unaccountable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding our ſelves into Parties, and purſuing particular <hi>Piques</hi> and <hi>Quarrels,</hi> not only to the <hi>neglect,</hi> but to the plain <hi>ruin</hi> of our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Intereſts.</p>
               <p>Theſe are the things that have hinder'd our Succeſſes, and provoked God's Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt us; and till theſe things be
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:63712:230"/>amended, I am afraid, we ſhall never be a happy Nation.</p>
               <p>But yet, notwithſtanding our high Provo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations, yet ſo gently hath God corrected us, and even in his <hi>Judgments</hi> ſo much hath He remembred <hi>Mercy,</hi> that we have all reaſon to rejoyce at the Benignity and Kindneſs of His Diſpenſations towards us; nay, and to render Him our moſt hearty and ſolemn Thanks, for the Mercies that He hath beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon us, even with reſpect to the Matters we complain of.</p>
               <p>For God hath really ſo far heard our Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers this Year, that He hath given us the moſt important Succeſſes, tho' not the Succeſſes we deſir'd.</p>
               <p>He hath kept the <hi>War</hi> at a diſtance from us; and we have, under the Happy Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>Her Majeſty,</hi> lived free from all Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſturbance at home; every man <hi>ſitting under his own Vine, and his own Fig-tree,</hi> (as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet ſpeaks) enjoying his Religion and Rights in perfect Peace; and with a bountiful Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion likewiſe, from God's Hand, of all the Things that were either needful or conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient.</p>
               <p>And as for our Succeſſes abroad, tho' it is not proper for me to talk of thoſe matters, yet I believe thus much I may decently and truly ſay, That tho' the <hi>King</hi> had not the <hi>Victory,</hi> being over-power'd by <hi>Numbers;</hi> yet he gained more <hi>Honour,</hi> and ſuſtain'd leſs
<pb n="454" facs="tcp:63712:231"/>
                  <hi>Loſs</hi> than thoſe that boaſted of the <hi>Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctory.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And which is yet more, God hath not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>Preſerved</hi> his <hi>Perſon,</hi> amidſt the infinite Hazards he was continually expoſed to, and <hi>Returned</hi> him <hi>ſafe</hi> to us, but returned him like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with ſuch Reputation for his <hi>Courage,</hi> and <hi>Vigilance,</hi> and <hi>Conduct</hi> in the Difficulties he had to ſtruggle with, as hath gained him the <hi>highest Eſteem</hi> among his <hi>Enemies,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought much more to <hi>endear</hi> him to his own <hi>Subjects.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And now, let all this be conſidered, and then let any man ſay, that really loves the Intereſt of his Country, whether we have not reaſon to look upon theſe things as <hi>Great Bleſſings;</hi> and as ſuch, to return our Solemn Thanks to God for them.</p>
               <p>And then in the <hi>Second</hi> place, as to our <hi>Fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Succeſſes,</hi> let us all chearfully depend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God's Providence, and truſt in his Mercy for them.</p>
               <p>This is all the <hi>Rejoycing</hi> we can expreſs as to Future things; and this is that which the Apoſtle calls <hi>Rejoycing in Hope.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſurely great Reaſon have we thus to do, when we conſider who it is that orders our Affairs; One, whoſe <hi>Kindneſs</hi> we have no reaſon to doubt of, having had ſo many Experiences of it, even beyond our hopes and Expectations: And one likewiſe upon
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:63712:231"/>whoſe <hi>Power</hi> we may ſecurely depend, ſince <hi>His Arm is not ſhortned,</hi> nor ever can be, how much ſoever our <hi>Arm of Fleſh</hi> may.</p>
               <p>God Almighty is our <hi>King,</hi> and He both certainly <hi>knows,</hi> and will certainly <hi>do,</hi> that which is <hi>beſt</hi> for us, provided we take care to do that which becomes <hi>us.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Away therefore with all <hi>Fear,</hi> and <hi>Diſtrust,</hi> and <hi>Deſpondency;</hi> it is an Argument of <hi>Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity</hi> and <hi>Irreligion,</hi> as well as <hi>Cowardiſe,</hi> to <hi>deſpair of the Commonwealth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We are in as good Hands as it is poſſible for us to be: Nay, we our ſelves cannot wiſh to be in any other.</p>
               <p>Let but us do our Parts, by qualifying our ſelves for God's Mercies; and that is to be done by contributing our beſt Endeavours, every man in his Place and Station, to the Service of the Publick; and then we may ſafely <hi>cast all our care upon him who careth for us,</hi> and we may be ſure we ſhall not be diſappointed.</p>
               <p>This Method, as it is much more eaſie, ſo we ſhall find it much more conducing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the obtaining the Succeſſes we deſire, than <hi>Complaining,</hi> and <hi>Fretfulneſs,</hi> and a tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menting <hi>Anxiety</hi> about our Affairs.</p>
               <p>We may indeed, by our <hi>Peeviſh</hi> and <hi>Querulous Humour,</hi> diſquiet our ſelves, and put others into a <hi>Ferment,</hi> nay, and at laſt, perhaps, may contribute a great deal to the <hi>Glory</hi> of hindring and defeating the moſt wiſe Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:63712:232"/>that are propoſed for our <hi>Safety;</hi> but that is the greateſt Point we gain.</p>
               <p>God Almighty will not alter his Methods for any of our fooliſh <hi>Paſſions;</hi> but there is a way to prevail upon God himſelf, to do for us all that our own Hearts can deſire, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that which we deſire be good for us; and that way is, to <hi>own</hi> Him and his Government; to <hi>love</hi> him, and to <hi>ſerve</hi> him; to be <hi>thankful</hi> for his Mercies; to be <hi>eaſie</hi> and <hi>chearful</hi> under all his Diſpenſations to us; and laſtly to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr our ſelves entirely to his Wiſe Counſels, and to <hi>trust</hi> in his <hi>Mercy</hi> for all that is to come.</p>
               <p>Great indeed, and wonderful, are the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes that are made to thoſe that put their <hi>Trust in God.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Jer. 17.5.</note>

                  <pb n="457" facs="tcp:63712:232"/>yet what have we all to do, but to <hi>Rejoyce</hi> in GOD, and to <hi>Trust</hi> in his Mercy?</p>
               <p>All is well, and All will be well for ever to them that Love <hi>God,</hi> and put their Truſt in Him.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Sing we therefore unto the Lord a New Song: Let the Congregation of Saints praiſe him. Let</hi> Iſrael <hi>rejoice in him that made him: And let the Children of</hi> Sion <hi>be joyful in their King. God is the King of all the Earth, let us ſing praiſes with underſtanding. The Lord hath pleaſure in his People: He will for ever help the meek hearted: For his delight is in them that fear him, and that put their trust in his mercy. He is our help and Strength, a very preſent help in Trouble: therefore will we not fear, though the Earth be moved, and though the hills be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into the midst of the Sea: Though the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters thereof rage and ſwell, and the Mountains ſhake at the tempest of the ſame. Even,</hi> in that caſe, <hi>the Rivers of the flood thereof ſhall make glad the City of God.</hi> All the Bluſterings and Storms that threaten <hi>God's People,</hi> ſhall turn to their Advantage, and ſhall really at length prove matter of rejoycing to them, how terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and dreadful ſoever they appeared at firſt: For, as it there follows, <hi>God is in the midst of her, therefore ſhall ſhe not be removed: God will help her, and that right early.</hi> God will be with his Church, and will deliver his People whenever it is proper and ſeaſonable ſo to do.</p>

               <p>Nay, let the <hi>Worst</hi> come; tho' we were reduced even to the utmoſt Extremities; which yet, <hi>God</hi> be thanked, we neither are, nor.

               <p>
                  <hi>Although the fig-tree ſhall not bloſſom, neither ſhall fruit be in the vine: Although the labour of the olive ſhall fail; and the fields ſhall yield no meat: Although the flock ſhall be cut off from the fold, and there be no herd in the ſtalls; yet will I rejoyce in the Lord, I will joy in the God of my ſalvation.</hi>

               </epigraph>
               <p>THE Argument with which this Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience was entertained the laſt <hi>Lord's Day,</hi> being the <hi>Government of the Tongue;</hi> I cannot think it improper or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſonable for me, who have the Honour to come next, to treat about the <hi>Government of the Thoughts:</hi> There being a near relation
<pb n="260" facs="tcp:63712:234"/>between theſe two, and a neceſſary depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the one upon the other.</p>
               <p>Our <hi>Words</hi> indeed are more eaſily govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than our <hi>Thoughts,</hi> becauſe they are more in our Power. But it will be impoſſible ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to govern our <hi>Words</hi> or our <hi>Actions,</hi> as we ſhould, unleſs we firſt bring our <hi>Thoughts</hi> in ſome meaſure under Government.</p>
               <p>I muſt confeſs this Argument of the <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the Thoughts,</hi> though it be a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry uſeful, yet it ſeems alſo a very nice and difficult one, through the great variety of Caſes, ariſing from Mens different Tempers, which will not come under the ſame Rules, and yet ought to be provided for. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, this ſhall not diſcourage me from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking this Argument; it ſhall only make me more careful as to what I ſay about it. That is, to have reſpect, as much as I can, to all ſorts of Tempers, and to deliver what I have to ſay with ſo much Plainneſs, that every body may go along with me.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Words,</hi> upon which I ground my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, are thoſe of <hi>Solomon,</hi> which I have read unto you, and which contain one of thoſe Precepts that he lays down for the Religious Conduct of our Lives. <hi>Keep</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>thy Heart with all diligence for out of it are the iſſues of Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Not to trouble you with what others have ſaid upon this Text, I take the true Mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it to be this.</p>
               <pb n="461" facs="tcp:63712:234"/>
               <p>By the <hi>[Heart]</hi> here, which we are exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>keep,</hi> we are to underſtand the <hi>Inward Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Motions,</hi> and <hi>Affections</hi> of our Souls or Spirits; all which in the inſpired Writings are conſtantly ſaid to be ſeated in the <hi>Heart.</hi> This undoubtedly is the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture-Notion of the <hi>Heart.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And when we are here bid to <hi>keep our Hearts with all diligence,</hi> I think there is no queſtion to be made, the Meaning is, That we ſhould diligently attend to the Thoughts and Motions, and Affections of our Minds; that we ſhould watch them narrowly, leſt at any time we ſhould give our Conſent to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing we ought not. This is the meaning of <hi>keeping our Hearts with all diligence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And then a Reaſon is added, why it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us thus to keep them. And that is this. Becauſe <hi>out of the heart are the iſſues of Life.</hi> What is the Meaning of that Phraſe? Plainly this. The Iſſues, the Fruits, the Effects that are ſhewn in our Lives and Converſation, do certainly proceed from the Heart, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, accordingly as that is well, or ill <hi>guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded</hi> or <hi>kept,</hi> ſo will our Lives and Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be. The Goodneſs or Badneſs of our Lives doth altogether depend upon the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending or not attending to the <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and Motions, and Inclinations of our Minds. As our Caution and Watchfulneſs in this Point is greater or leſs, ſo will our Courſe of Life be better or worſe. And therefore it concerns
<pb n="462" facs="tcp:63712:235"/>us all, that mean to live well, to be infinitely careful in this matter.</p>
               <p>This is a plain Account of the Advice that is here given us. So that you ſee, if I mean to diſcourſe pertinently to my Text, my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument muſt be (what I ſaid) the Care, and Management, and <hi>Government</hi> of our <hi>Thoughts,</hi> as they fall under a Religious Conſideration.</p>
               <p>In treating of this Argument there ſeem to me <hi>Two</hi> Things needful to be done:</p>
               <list>
                  <item>
                     <hi>First,</hi> To give an Account what Power a Man hath over his own <hi>Thoughts.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> To ſhew wherein the Art of <hi>Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verning</hi> of them doth conſiſt.</item>
               </list>
               <p>It is indeed this <hi>ſecond</hi> thing which my Text naturally leads me to ſpeak to: But I cannot ſpeak to that to any purpoſe, till I have made way for it by clearing the <hi>first.</hi> It is in vain to give Rules about the <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> of our <hi>Thoughts,</hi> till we know how far we have Power over them; how far they fall, or do not fall, under our Conduct and Management.</p>
               <p>And I muſt needs ſay, that moſt of thoſe I have met with, that have diſcours'd about the <hi>Government of Thoughts,</hi> by not inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring into, and ſettling this Point, have been ſo far from benefiting all their Hearers, that deſired to receive benefit by their good ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, that to ſeveral of them they have done
<pb n="463" facs="tcp:63712:235"/>harm: Becauſe as to <hi>them</hi> their advices have been perfectly unpracticable. Now thoſe that by their own Experience found them to be ſo, inſtead of conſidering that that Teacher might be in a miſtake, or that He did not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently weigh and examine the Caſe of all Perſons he gave his advice to, have peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torily concluded that they themſelves were in the fault, and therefore they were in an evil condition, becauſe they found themſelves not able to live up to what was adviſed them.</p>
               <p>The <hi>first</hi> Queſtion then is, <hi>How far a Man hath power over his own Thoughts.</hi> There is not indeed any ſingle Anſwer to be given to this Queſtion, that will fit all Men. For that is impoſſible. It would be as unreaſonable to demand it, as it would be to require of a Workman to make a Garment, that ſhould fit all ſorts and ſizes of Men.</p>
               <p>Some Men by the very Principles of their Make and Conſtitution, are much better a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to govern their Thoughts than others. Some that are naturally weaker, have by long uſe and many tryals obtained a greater power over their Thoughts than others. Again, the ſame Perſons that at ſome times have a greater power over the motions of their Minds, may at other times have a leſs Command over them; and this according as their Health, or their Buſineſs, or a hundred Contingencies of outward things do affect them. So that all that can be done, as to this matter, is to lay
<pb n="464" facs="tcp:63712:236"/>down ſome general Propoſitions, which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Body is to apply to himſelf as there is Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion. And Five of this kind I have to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, and which, I think, will take in all, or the greateſt part of what belongs to this Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
               <p>The <hi>first</hi> Propoſition I lay down is this, That the firſt Motions of our Minds are very little, if at all, in our power.</p>
               <p>By the <hi>first motions of our Minds,</hi> I mean thoſe ſudden Thoughts, or Apprehenſions, or Paſſions, or Deſires, which are excited in our Minds by any Object that is at that time preſented to our Imagination, As to theſe, I ſay, we are not ſo much Maſters of our ſelves as to be able to ſtop them; nay, tho' perhaps they be very irregular. And the Reaſon is, becauſe they are produced ſo quick, that there is not time enough given for Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to interpoſe.</p>
               <p>There is no neceſſity indeed that a Man ſhould give Conſent to theſe Motions; but as for their coming into his Mind, he can no more help it, than he can help his preſent Temper, or the preſent Circumſtances he is ingaged in.</p>
               <p>Thus for Inſtance. Do you think it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for a Man that is of a Fiery Paſſionate Temper, to avoid the feeling a ſudden Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of Anger ariſing in his Mind, if he meets with any unexpected Affront or other great Provocation? Or for a Man that deſires
<pb n="456" facs="tcp:63712:236"/>to be well thought of, not to entertain ſome Vanity of Imagination, when he hears him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf commended or flatter'd? Or for a Man that is addicted to Pleaſures, not to feel ſome irregular Inclinations in himſelf towards the gratifying his Appetites in thoſe things, when he hath all the Temptations before him? And thus in all other Caſes.</p>
               <p>I grant indeed that a Man by long Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, and a ſerious exerciſing himſelf in the ways of Vertue and Piety, may bring him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to that Temper, that he ſhall not have ſo many irregular, undecent Motions in his own Mind, upon any occaſion whatſoever, as he was wont to have; and that thoſe that were formerly <hi>Temptations</hi> to him, will at laſt be none: But ſtill I ſay, the firſt Motions and Workings of his Mind however they be oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned, are in a great meaſure out of his power; he cannot ſtop them; and therefore the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>governing</hi> his <hi>Thoughts</hi> doth not lye there.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> Propoſition I lay down is this, When a Man's Mind is vigorouſly affected and poſſeſſed, either with the outward Objects of ſenſe, or with inward Paſſions of any kind, in that Caſe he hath little or no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of his Thoughts. His Mind at that time will be in a manner wholly taken up with that it is then full of: Nor will he be able, till thoſe Impreſſions be worn off, to think freely of what he pleaſeth.</p>
               <pb n="466" facs="tcp:63712:237"/>
               <p>Thus for Inſtance, When a Man is under a ſharp, tormenting Pain; as he cannot avoid the <hi>feeling</hi> of that Pain, ſo neither can he avoid the <hi>thinking</hi> of it. When one is full of Grief for the loſs of a dear Relation; or tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported with Paſſion for ſome unworthy u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage he hath met with: It is in vain to ſay, Pray think not of theſe Matters; for theſe things muſt and will in a great meaſure im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his Thoughts, till his Paſſions do cool, and the Impreſſions that cauſed them be vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhed.</p>
               <p>Thus, for a Man to come from ſome Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in which he is more than ordinarily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned; or from the hearing ſome very good or very bad News; I ſay, to come freſh from this to the ſaying his Prayers: I do not, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wonder, that in this caſe his Mind will be much upon his <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> or his <hi>News,</hi> notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all his endeavours to the contrary.</p>
               <p>For the Nature of Man is ſuch, that he cannot ſo of a ſudden turn his mind from one <hi>Buſineſs</hi> to another; but that if he did cloſely and vigorouſly apply himſelf to the firſt <hi>Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> his Thoughts will for ſome time run upon it, even after he hath applied his Mind to the other.</p>
               <p>I do not deny, but that a Man may often ſo order his Affairs, as to be able to keep his Mind clear and free from ſuch Prepoſſeſſions as I am now ſpeaking of, ſo as that when he comes to apply himſelf to any <hi>Buſineſs</hi> he
<pb n="467" facs="tcp:63712:237"/>hath a mind to, he may intend it with his whole Might. But this I ſay, If our Minds be once engaged with warm Thoughts about any thing; it is very hard, if not impoſſible, to get them diſengaged on a ſudden. So that the <hi>Art</hi> of <hi>Governing</hi> our <hi>Thoughts</hi> doth not much lie in that neither.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> There are ſome Caſes likewiſe, where a Man's Thoughts are in a manner forced upon him, from the preſent Temper and Indiſpoſition of his Body. So that though he be in no Paſſion, though there be no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual Objects of Senſe that excite thoſe Thoughts in him; nay, though he never ſo much reſolve not to think upon thoſe things; yet ſo long as that Habit of Body laſts, he cannot avoid thoſe kind of thoughts: So that in this Caſe alſo, there is little room left for the <hi>Government</hi> of <hi>Thoughts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which I now ſay, happens frequently, not only in all ſorts of Diſtempers where the Brain is viſibly diſturbed, as in Feavers, and the like; which often cauſe a thouſand deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Fancies, and ſometimes down-right Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Diſtraction: But alſo in other Caſes where there ſeems to be no Feaver, or other viſible Diſtemper; nor doth the Brain, as to other matters, ſeem to be at all diſorder'd; but the perſons, in all appearance are ſound both in Body and Mind.</p>
               <p>And this is the Caſe of ſome deeply <hi>Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chondriac</hi> Perſons; many of which will be
<pb n="468" facs="tcp:63712:238"/>haunted with a <hi>Sett</hi> of <hi>Thoughts</hi> and <hi>Fancies,</hi> that they can by no means get rid of though they deſire it never ſo earneſtly.</p>
               <p>Sometimes they cannot get it out of their Heads, but that they are <hi>Atheiſts</hi> and <hi>Infidels;</hi> they neither believe in God nor in Jeſus Chriſt, nor have any ſenſe at all of Religion.</p>
               <p>Sometimes they are tormented with <hi>Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous</hi> Thoughts, and they cannot ſet them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the Performance of any Office of Devotion but a thouſand impious Fancies will come in and ſpoil all.</p>
               <p>Sometimes they fancy they are guilty of ſeveral grievous Crimes, which it is to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, it was hardly poſſible they ſhould be guilty of: nay, you cannot convince them but that they do every day commit ſome of theſe Crimes, becauſe they imagine they give con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to them.</p>
               <p>And whilſt theſe ſorts of Thoughts fill their Imaginations, there is not a Paſſage in the Bible that they read, nor a Sermon that they hear, but they find ſomething in it, which they do ſo perverſly apply to their own Caſe, as thereby to increaſe their trouble, but not to get any relief.</p>
               <p>I have known ſeveral well-diſpoſed Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and ſome of them ſincerely Pious, that have been in this Condition.</p>
               <p>What now is to be ſaid to this? Why, it is very certain that all theſe Thoughts and Fancies are thruſt upon them, and are not the
<pb n="469" facs="tcp:63712:238"/>free, natural, voluntary Operations of their own Minds; but the effects of Vapours or Hypochondriac Melancholy. Nor can the Perſons themſelves any more help their thus Thinking, or Fancying, than they can help the Diſturbances of their Dreams when they have a mind to ſleep quietly. Indeed we may properly enough call theſe <hi>Fancies</hi> of theirs, their <hi>waking Dreams;</hi> as their <hi>Dreams</hi> are their <hi>ſleeping Fancies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Well, but now of all Perſons whatſoever, theſe People are moſt deſirous to have <hi>Rules</hi> given them for the <hi>Government</hi> of their <hi>Thoughts.</hi> And I cannot blame them, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe their Thoughts are certainly very Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome. But truely, if we ſhould ſpeak per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinently to their Caſe, inſtead of giving them Advices for the regulating their <hi>Thoughts,</hi> they ſhould rather be adviſed to look after their <hi>Bodies,</hi> and by the help of good Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcriptions to get rid of thoſe <hi>Fumes</hi> and <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pours</hi> which occaſion theſe Fancies. When the Cauſe is removed, the effect will ſoon ceaſe. I do not in the leaſt doubt, whatever theſe People may think of their own Caſe, but that this is as properly a <hi>Bodily</hi> Diſeaſe as a <hi>Feaver,</hi> or Fits of the <hi>Falling Sickneſs.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In the mean time, while they are in this Condition, whatever Rules are proper to be given to other Perſons for the <hi>Government</hi> of the <hi>Thoughts,</hi> of all People living thoſe <hi>Rules</hi> do the leaſt concern them. For thoſe Thoughts
<pb n="470" facs="tcp:63712:239"/>which they complain of, do not at all fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Regulation or Government; becauſe they are ſuggeſted to their Minds whether they will or no. And for my part, I think it a great deal more adviſable (if it could be) to neglect and deſpiſe them; than to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually ſtrugling and diſputing with them, and vexing themſelves about them.</p>
               <p>But, you will ſay, If Men be ſuch Slaves to their <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and are thus neceſſarily paſſive under them, where is the Freedom of <hi>Thought?</hi> To this I anſwer,</p>
               <p>In the <hi>fourth</hi> place, out of theſe <hi>three</hi> Caſes I before mentioned, we have <hi>Liberty of Thinking,</hi> and may chuſe our own Thoughts. And that Liberty and Freedom we have in <hi>Thinking,</hi> doth, to my apprehenſion, mainly conſiſt in this, <hi>viz.</hi> That all of us (who are not in the Circumſtances I have been hitherto ſpeaking of) can, if we pleaſe, apply our Minds more vigorouſly to one ſort of thing than to another; and accordingly as we do thus apply our Minds, ſo will the moſt of our <hi>Thoughts</hi> be.</p>
               <p>It is in our power among the multitude of Objects which preſent themſelves to our Mind, (as for Inſtance, <hi>God, Vertue, Holineſs, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Wealth, Power, Greatneſs, Preferments, Fine Cloaths, Splendid Equipage, Senſual Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, Recreations, Divertiſements, Knowledge, Learning, Arts,</hi> and the like:) I ſay, that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong all this multitude of Objects that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="471" facs="tcp:63712:239"/>themſelves to our Minds) it is in our pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to determine our ſelves, which of them we will dwell upon, and make a <hi>Buſineſs</hi> of. And accordingly, when at any time we have pitched upon any of them, as a <hi>Buſineſs,</hi> it is in our power to mind that <hi>Buſineſs</hi> either more or leſs diligently. And if it be ſuch a one, as that we mean in good earneſt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern our ſelves about it, it will then ſo fill our Minds, as that by attending to that, we ſhall either prevent in a great meaſure other Thoughts from coming into our Heads; or if they do come in, they will not long ſtay there, but will very ſpeedily give place to that which is our main Buſineſs at that time.</p>
               <p>And the Reaſon of this is plain; Becauſe our Natures are of that Make, that two things at once cannot well poſſeſs our Minds; and therefore if we be intent about one thing, we cannot have much room or leiſure for Thoughts of another Nature.</p>
               <p>But then <hi>Fifthly</hi> and laſtly, Though this that I have ſaid be the true Nature of that power we have over our Thoughts, as to the directing them to a particular Object: Yet there is another power we have over them that ought here more eſpecially to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered; becauſe in it are laid the very Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Vice,</hi> and upon account of it, all our thoughts become either morally <hi>good</hi> or <hi>evil.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="472" facs="tcp:63712:240"/>
               <p>That which I mean is this. Though we cannot in many Caſes, think always of what we would; nay, though we cannot hinder abundance of Thoughts from coming into our Minds againſt our will: Yet it is always in our power to aſſent to our Thoughts, or to deny our Conſent to them. And here it is that the <hi>Morality</hi> of our <hi>Thoughts</hi> begins. According as we <hi>Aſſent</hi> or <hi>Diſſent</hi> to the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that are made in our Minds; ſo will our <hi>Thoughts</hi> have the Notion of <hi>Vertuous</hi> or <hi>Sinful</hi> Thoughts.</p>
               <p>When any Temptations are preſented to us from without, we cannot perhaps (as I ſaid before) avoid the feeling an irregular Paſſion, or Motion, or Inclination ſtirring within us upon occaſion thereof: But yet at that very time it is in our power, whether we will comply with thoſe Paſſions and Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, or not; whether we will conſent to them, or not; whether we will purſue them further, or not. Now if we do not conſent to them, but endeavour to ſtop, and ſtifle, and reſiſt them as ſoon as we are aware of them; there is yet no harm done. Our <hi>Thoughts,</hi> how undecent or irregular ſoever they were, are rather to be accounted the <hi>Infirmities</hi> of our <hi>Corrupt</hi> Nature, than our <hi>Sins</hi> properly ſo called.</p>
               <p>And thus it is likewiſe as to our <hi>Wandring Thoughts</hi> in our <hi>Prayers.</hi> If we ſtrive againſt them, and endeavour to keep our Minds in a
<pb n="473" facs="tcp:63712:240"/>Devout Compoſed Temper, and attend as well as we can to the Duty we are about: I ſay, if we do this, I hope thoſe <hi>Diſtractions</hi> and <hi>Wandrings</hi> will never riſe up in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt us.</p>
               <p>And as for the frightful <hi>Blaſphemous</hi> Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, which, as I told you, ſome, even Pious Perſons are tormented with: As to them, I ſay, they, of all other irregular <hi>Thoughts,</hi> have the leaſt danger of Sin in them, though they be not ſo ſolemnly and formally diſputed with, and conteſted againſt. Becauſe indeed they are ſo terrible in their own Nature, that no Man in his Wits, and that hath any ſenſe of God or Goodneſs, can be ſuppoſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to them. They are indeed great <hi>Infeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities,</hi> but by no means any <hi>Sin,</hi> any farther than we approve of them; and to approve of them, for any tolerable good Man is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible.</p>
               <p>But then on the other ſide, If we conſent to any wicked Motion or Inclination that we feel in our ſelves; let it come in how it will, never ſo ſuddenly, never ſo unexpectedly; if we cloſe with any <hi>Thought</hi> that prompts us to Evil, ſo as to be pleaſed with it, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light in it, to think of purſuing it, till it be brought into Action: In that caſe we are no longer to plead our <hi>Original Corruption;</hi> for in that very Inſtant we become <hi>Actual Sinners,</hi> Actual Tranſgreſſors of the Law of God, the Obligation of which reaches to our very Hearts
<pb n="474" facs="tcp:63712:241"/>and Thoughts as well as our Actions. Tho' yet we are not ſo great Tranſgreſſors, ſo long as our Sin is only in Thought, or De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire, or Purpoſe; as if it had proceeded to outward Action.</p>
               <p>All this is taught us for true Divinity, by no leſs an Author than St. <hi>James,</hi> in the firſt Chapter of his <hi>Epiſtle,</hi> v. 13, 14, 15, <hi>Let no man ſay when he is tempted, I am tempted of of God; for God tempteth no man. But every man is tempted when he is drawn away of his own lust, and enticed. Then when lust hath conceived, it bringeth forth ſin, and ſin, when it is finiſhed, bringeth forth Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Which paſſage of the Apoſtle doth plainly contain theſe <hi>three</hi> Propoſitions.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> That no man is drawn to commit Sin by any State or Condition that God hath put him into; no, nor by any Temptation, either outward or inward, that is preſented to him. It is not a Sin to be tempted; no, nor to ſeel that we are tempted by ſome diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly Inclination that ariſes in our Minds thereupon.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>ſecondly,</hi> then our Sin begins, when we yield to the Temptation, when we are <hi>drawn away by our own Luſts, and enticed,</hi> when they get the Victory over us, and we do conſent to them. Then <hi>Lust hath conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and bringeth forth Sin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Though the very conſent of our Wills to a Temptation, be a Sin in us;
<pb n="475" facs="tcp:63712:241"/>yet that Sin is not ſo great as it will be after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, if it be brought to Action. Sin in the deſire or purpoſe, is but an <hi>Embryo;</hi> it is but the firſt Rudiments of Sin, but when it comes to be acted, it is then a Sin in its full dimenſions; and the Conſequences of it may be Fatal without Repentance. <hi>Sin when it is finiſhed bringeth forth Death.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having thus given ſome Account, how far our <hi>Hearts</hi> or <hi>Thoughts</hi> do fall under <hi>Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> I now come to my <hi>Second</hi> Point, that is, to treat of the <hi>Art of Governing them,</hi> or to lay down the neceſſary <hi>Rules</hi> and <hi>Directions</hi> which are to obſerved in order thereunto.</p>
               <p>And we ſhall not need to go far for theſe <hi>Rules,</hi> for they will all naturally flow from the Principles I have already laid down. And I think, they may conveniently enough be reduced likewiſe to theſe <hi>Five</hi> following.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> From what hath been ſaid, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the <hi>First</hi> and great Point to be done by us, if we would keep our <hi>Hearts</hi> in a good Frame, and order our <hi>Thoughts</hi> to good purpoſes, is, that we rightly pitch our main Deſigns; that we chuſe that for the great buſineſs of our Lives, that really ought to be ſo.</p>
               <p>Now what that is, can bear no diſpute with any Man that will fairly uſe his Reaſon. For certainly, that which is our greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment in the World, ought to be our great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Buſineſs and Deſign in the World.</p>
               <pb n="476" facs="tcp:63712:242"/>
               <p>And it is evident to every one, that believes he hath a Soul to ſave, that his greateſt Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment of all, is, to approve himſelf to that God who made him, and diſpoſes of all his affairs; and who accordingly as we ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely endeavour, or not endeavour to ſerve him, will make us either very Happy, or very Miſerable, both in this Life and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So that there can, as I ſaid, be no Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpute about what ought to be the great Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Deſign of our whole Lives, and to which all other Buſineſſes muſt yield.</p>
               <p>Now if we be ſo wiſe, as really to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this as our main End, and reſolve to mind it, and follow it as ſuch; I ſay, if we be ſo wiſe as to do this; we have made a very great ſtep towards the obtaining a ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to our ſelves, that the greateſt part of our Thoughts and Deſires, and Affections, will be ſuch as they ſhould be; ſuch as will be acceptable to God, and ſatisfactory to our ſelves.</p>
               <p>For as I told you before, whatever is our main Buſineſs, be it what it will, it will, in a great meaſure, draw all our Thoughts to it. Our Natures are ſo contrived that we muſt always be thinking of ſomething or other. But then they are ſo contrived like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that we think moſt of that, which is moſt in our Eye, moſt in our Eſteem, moſt in our Purſuit. And this is that which our Saviour tells us; <hi>Where your treaſure is, there
<pb n="477" facs="tcp:63712:242"/>will your heart be alſo.</hi> Whatever it be that you place your Happineſs in, upon that will your Thoughts run; upon that will your Deſires, your Inclinations, your Affections, be fixed.</p>
               <p>We have a World of inſtances of the truth of this every day before our Eyes. If a Man hath ſet his heart on <hi>Money,</hi> and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſeth it to himſelf, as the <hi>Buſineſs</hi> of his Life, to be Rich: Why, I dare ſay, ſuch an one will own to you, that moſt of his Thoughts are upon that Project; and that he finds it ſo far from being difficult to keep his Mind cloſe and ſteady to his <hi>Main Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest,</hi> as he calls it; that it is rather difficult to him to think of any other Matters.</p>
               <p>If a Man be given up to <hi>Pleaſure,</hi> and thinks nothing worthy his living for, but Wine and Women, and good Eating and good Company; Is it not natural to ſuch an one to bend all his Thoughts that way? Or doth he put any force or violence upon him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in thinking and contriving all the day long, how to bring to paſs the Gratification of his Luſts or his Appetites.</p>
               <p>Why, my <hi>Brethren,</hi> if we did all of us in good earneſt make the Service of God, and the purchaſing Heaven and Happineſs to our ſelves, as much our Buſineſs, our End, our Deſign, as theſe Men make Wealth or Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to be theirs, we ſhould certainly be thus affected. The common Courſe of our <hi>Thoughts,</hi>
                  <pb n="478" facs="tcp:63712:243"/>would naturally and eaſily, without the leaſt conſtraint, run upon thoſe Objects: And we ſhould take as great delight in Thinking of <hi>our</hi> Treaſure, and Contriving for the obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it; as they do in Thinking and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting for theirs.</p>
               <p>I ſay, Thus it would be with us. For I cannot for my Life apprehend, what Charms there can be in Worldly or Senſual Things, to attract a Man's Mind; what Fetters there can be in them, to <hi>bind</hi> his <hi>Thoughts,</hi> and tye them to themſelves: But that there are the ſame, or greater, in Vertue and Goodneſs; in the Love and Favour of God; in a Pure Conſcience here, and Eternal Glory here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after: Always provided, that they are as much made the Objects of our Choice and Purſuit, as the other.</p>
               <p>And therefore I cannot but ſuſpect, where we ſee Men ſo very cold and backward to Spiritual Things; and ſo apt to ſpend all their Thoughts upon trifling, vain, or worldly Matters, that it is with a great deal of Pains and Reluctancy, that they can bring them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to think of their Everlaſting Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: I ſay, I cannot but ſuſpect that theſe Perſons have not yet <hi>laid up their Treaſure in Heaven,</hi> as our Saviour expreſſeth it; they have not yet ſo wholly devoted themſelves to the Service of God, as to make it their <hi>Main Buſineſs.</hi> When once they have done that, I dare aſſure them, they will find it ſo far
<pb n="479" facs="tcp:63712:243"/>from being a force upon them, to think of good things, that it will be very natural to them; and they will find the greateſt Pleaſure in the World in ſo doing.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whoever would <hi>keep</hi> his <hi>Heart</hi> always in a good Frame, and be able to give a good Account of his Thoughts to God, muſt have an eſpecial care to avoid <hi>two</hi> things, <hi>viz. Idleneſs,</hi> and <hi>looſe Company.</hi> For both of theſe do ſtrangely unhinge a Man's Mind; and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm it of that Severity, which is its beſt guard and defence againſt Evil Thoughts; and make it become an eaſie prey to every Temptation that will attack it.</p>
               <p>A wiſe Man ſhould never be at ſuch a paſs, as to ſay, <hi>I have nothing to do, I do not know how to ſpend my next Hour:</hi> But ſhould ſo order the Courſe of his Life, that all the Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Time, as much as is poſſible, may be filled with ſome uſeful, or at leaſt come innocent Imployment.</p>
               <p>It is <hi>Idleneſs,</hi> and having nothing to do, that is the Mother of moſt of thoſe vain, and unprofitable, and ſinful Fancies, in which ſome Men ſpend their days. And whereas Temptations do now and then come in the way of other Men; the <hi>Idle</hi> Man is forced to ſeek out Temptations for the ſhipwrack of his Vertue. And therefore no wonder if he that ſeeks them, finds abundance of them.</p>
               <p>And truely, <hi>Looſe</hi> and <hi>Impertinent Converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> which was the other thing I named,
<pb n="480" facs="tcp:63712:244"/>though its looks ſomething with a better Grace yet is not much better than Idleneſs. For where-ever it is much uſed, it will ſo emaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate a Man's Mind, and take off the edge and vigour of it, as to ſerious things, that he cannot eaſily get it into a good Frame again. <hi>Evil Communication</hi> (ſaith St. <hi>Paul</hi>) <hi>doth cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt good Manners.</hi> And therefore thoſe peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, a great part of whoſe Life is taken up in gadding up and down; in Play; in merry Meetings; in telling or hearing idle Stories, and the like: It is impoſſible but their Thoughts and Inclinations, and the whole Frame of their Hearts will be ſuitable; that is to ſay, very frothy; very light and fooliſh; not to ſay, profane, and wicked, and Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical too, if the Company they much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with, be of that ſtrain.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> Another thing of great moment, for the <hi>keeping our Hearts,</hi> is, to be as atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive as is poſſible to the <hi>first Motions</hi> of our Minds; and whenever we find that they tend toward ſomething that is forbidden, to ſtop them as ſoon as we can.</p>
               <p>We cannot, as I told you before, often prevent irregular Deſires, or Paſſions, or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, from ariſing in our Minds, upon ſundry occaſions. But this we can do: As ſoon as we are aware of them, we can refuſe our Conſent to them; (and in that caſe I hope they will not be imputed to us as Sins;) Nay, not only ſo, but we can refuſe their
<pb n="481" facs="tcp:63712:244"/>breaking out, or ſhewing themſelves in our <hi>Words,</hi> or our <hi>Actions.</hi> For the Motions of our outward Members are all at our Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, though the firſt Motions of our Minds be not.</p>
               <p>Here therefore will ly a main Point in the Art of well governing our Minds and Thoughts. You cannot perhaps, for inſtance, prevent a ſudden Paſſion of <hi>Anger</hi> from ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing in your Minds upon <hi>twenty</hi> Accidents; But as ſoon as you feel this Paſſion, you can thus far ſtifle it; you can ſeal up your Mouth, ſo that the Paſſion ſhall not vent it ſelf in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly Words; And if you will withdraw that Fuel from the new-kindled Fire, it will ſoon be extinguiſhed, and die. Whereas if you ſuffer it to break out in bitter Speeches and Expreſſions, it will flame beyond mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
               <p>Thus again if any undecent, impure Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies or Deſires ſhould be excited in you upon any occaſion: It was not perhaps in your power to keep them from coming into your Minds: But it is in your power to withdraw from the Temptation that cauſed them; and to endeavour to direct your Thoughts to ſome other Object; at leaſt not to proceed one ſtep in any outward Action towards the accompliſhing of thoſe Deſires. If you take this Courſe, the Diſturbance of your Mind will ſoon ceaſe, and you will return preſently to your ordinary Temper.</p>
               <pb n="482" facs="tcp:63712:245"/>
               <p>And let me tell you this further; That by your being thus careful to reſiſt and ſmother the firſt beginnings of Sin; you will not only preſerve, in a great meaſure, the Innocency of your Minds under the preſent Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but you will alſo have this farther ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that by this means, you increaſe your Power over your Thoughts, againſt the next time that the Temptation returns. Eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry check you give to the firſt motions of Sin, makes the next aſſault of them the leſs furi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. And if you do conſtantly uſe your ſelves, thus to Guard and Watch over your Hearts; you will in time obtain ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over them, that you will not be trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled with a quarter of thoſe irregular deſires, and paſſions, which heretofore upon ſeveral Occaſions uſed to be kindled in you. By this Method you will ſtrengthen your Faculties, and enlarge your Powers; and by degrees bring your ſelves to that happy Temper of Soul, that there will be no great <hi>War</hi> between the <hi>Law</hi> of your <hi>Members,</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> of your <hi>Minds:</hi> But the <hi>World</hi> and the <hi>Fleſh</hi> will be <hi>Crucified</hi> to you, as you are to them; that I may uſe St. <hi>Paul</hi>'s Expreſſions.</p>
               <p>But then <hi>Fourthly,</hi> That you may be able not only to keep <hi>bad</hi> Thoughts out of your Minds; but alſo to have a conſtant ſpring of <hi>good</hi> ones; there are ſome particular <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes</hi> very proper for this purpoſe to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended. Such I mean as theſe, <hi>Converſe
<pb n="483" facs="tcp:63712:245"/>with diſcreet and pious Perſons; Reading good Books,</hi> eſpecially the <hi>Holy Scriptures;</hi> taking times of <hi>Meditation</hi> and <hi>Recollection;</hi> and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all, <hi>Fervent</hi> and <hi>Conſtant Prayer to God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It is not to be told how every one of theſe things doth help to inſpire us with good Thoughts and Purpoſes.</p>
               <p>A little paſſage now and then, though but occaſionally dropt in Converſation, that is to the buſineſs of <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> will ſupply us ſome times with matter for good <hi>Thoughts</hi> for a conſiderable while after. What laſting Impreſſions then, do you think, would be left upon our Minds, if we made it our conſtant Exerciſe every day, to read or hear ſomething out of the <hi>Bible,</hi> or ſome other <hi>good Book,</hi> with a deſign to grow Better thereby?</p>
               <p>But above all things, we muſt take care to be diligent and ſerious in our Applications to the Throne of Grace: it is Hearty Prayer and Devotion, that, when all is done, will prove the moſt Effectual Means, for the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Hearts ſteady to that which is Good, and ſecuring them from the pollutions of the ſenſible Earthly Objects that do ſurround us.</p>
               <p>O therefore let us be conſtant in our Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious Offices. Nay, let us take every op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity that our Affairs will allow us, of raiſing our Minds to God, and thanking him for his Infinite Love and Goodneſs to us; and imploring the continual Influences of his Grace
<pb n="484" facs="tcp:63712:246"/>and Holy Spirit, and re-inforcing our Vows and Purpoſes of perſevering in his Service.</p>
               <p>By this means we ſhall come to lead Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Lives indeed. Our Souls will be a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual Fountain of good Thoughts. And while we live here, our Converſation will be in Heaven. For God and Chriſt, and the things above will have our <hi>Hearts,</hi> though the World hath our <hi>Bodies.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But then, in the <hi>Fifth</hi> and laſt place, Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding what I have hitherto ſaid, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the <hi>Diligence</hi> with which we are to <hi>keep</hi> our <hi>Hearts;</hi> yet this is always to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, That with our <hi>Diligence</hi> we muſt be careful to joyn <hi>Diſcretion.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>My Meaning is this, We muſt have a care not to <hi>intend</hi> our Thoughts immoderately, and more than our Tempers will bear, even to the beſt things: But we muſt ſo <hi>keep</hi> our <hi>Hearts,</hi> as at the ſame time to preſerve our <hi>Healths,</hi> and keep up the Vigour of our Minds.</p>
               <p>And the way to do that, is, Not to put them too much, or too long, upon the ſtretch at any one time: But to relax them when there is occaſion, and to let them run out, and entertain themſelves upon any thing that comes next to hand, ſo long as it is Innocent.</p>
               <p>It is a vain thing to imagine, that we can always be thinking of our great Buſineſs; or that we can always be a Praying, or Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or Meditating; or, that, as our Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="485" facs="tcp:63712:246"/>is in this World, even the greater part of our <hi>Thoughts</hi> ſhould be ſuch as we call <hi>Devout</hi> and <hi>Religious Thoughts.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God hath provided a great deal of other Buſineſs for us to apply our Minds to, ſo long as we live in this World. And by mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that diligently and conſcientiouſly, we do ſerve God as acceptably, as if we were Reading or Praying.</p>
               <p>Nay even then, when we have no urgent Buſineſs upon our hands to take up our Minds, it is not neceſſary that we ſhould be always thinking of Religion. Nor would I call eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Thought, a <hi>vain,</hi> or an <hi>idle,</hi> or a <hi>ſinful</hi> Thought, that hath not God, or our Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Concernments for its Object. Even the moſt Spiritually minded among us, muſt often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times be content to be entertained with ſuch <hi>Thoughts</hi> as our Company, or our Temper, or the preſent Circumſtances we are in, do ſuggeſt to us. And provided thoſe <hi>Thoughts</hi> be innocent, and do not intrench upon the Laws of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Purity,</hi> and <hi>Charity;</hi> be they otherwiſe very trifling and impertinent: I ſay, I would not look upon them as <hi>ill Thoughts,</hi> nor have any one angry at himſelf upon account of them.</p>
               <p>The truth of it is, ſo long as we conſiſt of Bodies and Souls, we cannot always be think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſerious things. They indeed are the Wiſeſt that think of them moſt, but it is even dangerous to attempt to think of them always.
<pb n="486" facs="tcp:63712:247"/>For, as moſt Mens Conſtitutions are, that is the ready way to ſpoil the Habit of our Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, and by that means to render our Minds perfectly unfit for <hi>Thinking</hi> at all, to any good Purpoſes.</p>
               <p>Thus have I laid before you the Main Things wherein, as I do believe, the right <hi>Governing our Thoughts</hi> doth conſiſt. And I doubt not they are ſo ſafe, and ſo effectual, that whoſoever will ſincerely practiſe them, as far as he can, will ſo <hi>keep</hi> his <hi>Heart,</hi> that the <hi>Iſſues</hi> from thence in his <hi>Life</hi> and <hi>Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation</hi> will be Happy and Proſperous. I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude all with the <hi>Collect</hi> of this Day.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Almighty God, who ſeest that we have no power of our ſelves to help our ſelves; Keep us both outwardly in our Bodies, and inwardly in our Souls; that we may be defended from all Adverſities which may happen to the Body, and from all EVIL THO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>GHTS which may aſſault and hurt the Soul, through Jeſus Christ our Lord.</hi>

                        <hi>LUKE xviii. 1.</hi>
                     </bibl>
                     <p>And he ſpake a Parable unto them, to this end, That men ought always to pray, and not to faint.</p>
                  </q>
               </epigraph>
               <p>THE Parable which our Saviour ſpake unto them to this end was this; <hi>There was in a City a Judge, who feared not God nor regarded Men, and there was a Widow in that City, and ſhe came to him ſaying, Avenge me of my Adverſary. And he
<pb n="488" facs="tcp:63712:248"/>would not for a while: But afterwards he ſaid within himſelf, Though I fear not God, nor regard Man; Yet becauſe this Widow troubleth me, I will avenge her, lest by her continual co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming ſhe weary me.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Application of this Parable is eaſie and natural. If a Man that neither <hi>fears God,</hi> nor <hi>regards Men;</hi> hath neither Senſe of Religion nor Humanity; may be ſuppoſed to be ſo far prevail'd upon by the earneſt Prayer of a miſerable neceſſitous Perſon, as to grant the Requeſt made to him, and to adminiſter Relief to the Supplicant, merely upon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Continuance, and Importunity of the Petitions that are put up: Then how much more ought we to think that God, who is Infinite Goodneſs it ſelf; who is always kind and bountiful to his Creatures; who delights to do good to them, even without their ſeeking and deſiring it; and who is ſo far from being at any Pains or Trouble for the ſupplying their Wants, that it is altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as eaſie to him to do, what is requeſted of him, as not to do it: I ſay, How much more ought we to think that this God, upon our earneſt and hearty <hi>Prayer</hi> to him for any thing we ſtand in need of, will return us a kind Anſwer, and grant us ſuch Supplies as are proper for us. But then we are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, that we <hi>Pray always, and faint not.</hi> We muſt be diligent, and importunate, and
<pb n="489" facs="tcp:63712:248"/>perſevering in our Devotions, otherwiſe we are not to expect any more favourable return of them, than the Judge in the Parable made to the Widow upon her once or twice put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up her Petitions to him.</p>
               <p>This is the Effect of the Parable. I mean not now farther to inſiſt on it, but to ſtick to that point for the ſake of which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our framed it. <hi>Jeſus ſpake a Parable unto them to this end, That men ought always to pray, and not to faint.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But what is meant by <hi>praying always,</hi> and <hi>not fainting</hi> which our Lord here obliges us to? Is it to be always on our knees, and to mind no other buſineſs but Devotion? So in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed (they ſay) ſome of ancient times expoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it; but we meet with them no where, but in the Catalogues of the Hereticks. No cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, <hi>to pray always, and not to faint,</hi> doth imply a quite different thing, of which I ſhall give an account in the following parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Theſe words import, that we ſhould be always in a <hi>praying Temper,</hi> in ſuch a Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of mind, that we always carry about us, and have within us the neceſſary Requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites of hearty Prayer; that is to ſay, a firm Belief of God and his Providence, a lively Senſe of our own Sinfullneſs, and Weakneſs, and manifold Neceſſities; and an entire, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, conſtant Dependence upon the Divine Goodneſs for the Supply of them. In ſuch a
<pb n="490" facs="tcp:63712:249"/>Frame of Soul as this, I take, That <hi>Spirit of Prayer and Supplication,</hi> mentioned in the Scriptures, to conſiſt.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly, To pray always,</hi> likewiſe imports, that upon every ſolemn Occaſion we ſhould <hi>actually</hi> addreſs our ſelves to God: ſeeking help from him in all the ſtraits and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties we happen into; rendring our acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments for every Good that arrives to us in our lives; and imploring his Protection, his Guidance, his Bleſſing upon us, in every Work of Moment that we go about.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It imports farther that we ſhould at leaſt twice every day, either in publick, or in private, offer up the Sacrifice of <hi>Prayer</hi> and <hi>Praiſe</hi> in a ſolemn manner unto God. Leſs than this (I think) this Phraſe of <hi>Praying al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways,</hi> as likewiſe that other Expreſſion of St. <hi>Paul,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> v. 17.</note> that we ſhould <hi>pray without ceaſing:</hi> leſs than this, I ſay, they cannot ſignifie; but how much more I now enquire not. It is indeed very probable, as Interpreters have noted, that theſe Expreſſions are borrowed from, and have reſpect to the <hi>daily Sacrifices</hi> among the <hi>Jews.</hi> Every day twice (that is to ſay, in the Morning, and in the Evening) by the Appointment of God, was offer'd up a Sacrifice in the Temple; to which the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout People reſorted: Which Sacrifice is in Scripture called by the Name of the <hi>conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Sacrifice,</hi> the <hi>daily Sacrifice;</hi> the <hi>never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceaſing Sacrifice;</hi> and this in Contra-diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="491" facs="tcp:63712:249"/>to the <hi>occaſional</hi> Sacrifices which pious Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons uſed to bring thither. If now this be a true account of theſe Expreſſions, we cannot be ſaid <hi>to pray always, to pray without ceaſing, to pray continually,</hi> unleſs we do at leaſt <hi>twice</hi> every day, in the Morning, and in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offer up our ſolemn <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of <hi>Prayer</hi> to God.</p>
               <p>But <hi>Fourthly, To pray always, and not to faint,</hi> Implies great <hi>Earneſtneſs</hi> and <hi>Importunity</hi> in our Prayers. It imports that we ſhould not <hi>faintly</hi> Addreſs to God, but with Affection and Fervour; with a deep Sence of our Sins, and of our Wants; and a ſerious and fixed Atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to what we are about; and with very ardent deſires, and <hi>hungring</hi> and <hi>thirſting</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that <hi>Grace,</hi> or that <hi>Pardon,</hi> or that <hi>Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing</hi> that we pray for. And this is that kind of Prayer which St. <hi>James</hi> Styles <hi>the effectual fervent Prayer of a Righteous man,</hi> which,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Ch.</hi> v. 16.</note> he ſaith, <hi>availeth much.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Laſtly, To pray always, and not to faint,</hi> imports <hi>Continuance</hi> and <hi>Perſeverance</hi> in our Prayers. That we do not pray by Fits and Starts, and then intermit our Devotion; but conſtantly keep up the Fervour of our Minds towards God: Not giving over our Prayers,<note place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.12.</note> tho' we have not a Return of them ſo ſoon as we expect; But <hi>continuing inſtant in Prayer,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſpeaks, and <hi>watching thereunto with all perſeverance.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">
                     <hi>Eph.</hi> 6.18.</note>
               </p>
               <pb n="492" facs="tcp:63712:250" rendition="simple:additions"/>
               <p>Theſe are the chief things which are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized in this Command of our Saviour. Now to recommend the Practice hereof to you, and to offer ſome Arguments to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade every one thus <hi>to pray always, and not to faint,</hi> is that which I deſign in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part of this Diſcourſe.</p>
               <p>I do not know how it comes to paſs, that Men have generally ſo great an Averſion to this Duty of <hi>Prayer.</hi> They are very hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly got to it. They are glad of any Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in the World to be excuſed from it. And when they do come to perform their Devotions, (which among many is not oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner than the Laws or Cuſtoms of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey oblige them to) how ſoon are they weary of them! How little do they attend to the ſineſs they are about! As if indeed <hi>Prayer</hi> was one of the greateſt Burdens that God could lay upon Human Nature. Whereas in truth, if our Luſts and Paſſions were out of the way, and Men could be brought to give themſelves the Liberty of conſidering things equally; we ſhould be convinced that there is no Work that a Man can apply him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to; no Action that he can perform, to which there are greater Invitations, greater Motives; nay, I was going to ſay, greater <hi>Temptations</hi> of all ſorts, than to this of Prayer.</p>
               <p>Suppoſe one would ſet himſelf to perſwade any of us to the Practice of ſome particular
<pb n="493" facs="tcp:63712:250"/>thing which he hath a Mind to recommend to us; what more effectual Method could he take for the carrying of his Point, than to lay before us the common Heads of Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by which all Mankind are prevailed upon to undertake any Buſineſs or Action? And then to convince us, that the thing he would perſwade us to, is recommendable up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on all theſe accounts. As for inſtance, That it is a thing <hi>fit,</hi> and <hi>decent,</hi> and <hi>reaſonable</hi> to be done. Nay, 'tis a thing we are oblig'd in <hi>duty</hi> to do, even ſo far oblig'd, that we act againſt our <hi>Natures,</hi> if we do it not. Nor have we any juſt Exception againſt it. It is the moſt <hi>eaſie</hi> thing in the World. It will put us to no manner of <hi>Trouble,</hi> or <hi>Pains,</hi> or <hi>Self-Denial.</hi> So far from that, that it is very <hi>pleaſant</hi> and <hi>delightful.</hi> And not only ſo, but alſo highly <hi>creditable</hi> and <hi>honourable.</hi> And, which is the Top of all, the <hi>Benefits</hi> and <hi>Advantages</hi> we ſhall receive from it are extremely great in all reſpects. If now, I ſay, a Man can make all theſe things good of the Point he would perſwade us to; ſure all the World muſt account us out of our Wits, if we do not follow his Advice.</p>
               <p>Yet all theſe things, it may be evidently made to appear, are true of <hi>Prayer,</hi> and that too in a higher degree than of moſt things in the World. What therefore can be deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in this Exerciſe to recommend the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice thereof to us that it hath not? And
<pb n="494" facs="tcp:63712:251"/>what muſt be concluded of us, if, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this, we continue obſtinate in our Neglects of it? Give me leave to ſpeak a little to theſe ſeveral Particulars.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First</hi> of all; Doth it recommend any thing to our Practice that it is <hi>fit,</hi> and <hi>decent,</hi> and <hi>reaſonable</hi> to be done? Then certainly we muſt needs think our ſelves obliged to the conſtant Practice of this Point we are ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of. For there is nothing that doth more become us; nor is any thing more <hi>undecent,</hi> or more <hi>unreaſonable</hi> than the Neglect of it.</p>
               <p>Is it not fit that the Sovereign Lord of us, and of the World ſhould be acknowledged by us? That we who, do continually depend upon him, ſhould ever and anon be looking up to him, and expreſſing that Dependence? Is it not fit that we, who every moment ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience a thouſand Inſtances of his Kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, partake of a thouſand Mercies and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of his, and muſt periſh the next Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute unleſs they be continued to us; Is it not highly <hi>fit</hi> and <hi>reaſonable</hi> (I ſay) that we ſhould take notice at leaſt of theſe things to this our Benefactor?</p>
               <p>We ſhould think it very ill Manners to paſs by our <hi>Prince,</hi> or even any of our <hi>Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,</hi> without <hi>ſaluting</hi> them, or ſome way or other teſtifying our Reſpect to them, tho' they had no way particularly obliged us: But if we were beholding to them for our daily Bread; to come into their Preſence
<pb n="495" facs="tcp:63712:251"/>without taking notice of them, or their Bounty to us, would be intolerable. How much more intolerable therefore muſt it be, to paſs by God Almighty day after day; nay, to be in his Preſence continually, (as indeed we always are) and yet neither to pay any <hi>Homage</hi> or <hi>Reverence</hi> to him, as He is our Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme <hi>Lord,</hi> nor to make any Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as He is our daily <hi>Preſerver</hi> and <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefactor.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If we had any ſenſe of Ingenuity, we ſhould bluſh to think of paſſing a Day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeveral times lifting up our Minds, and doing our Reſpects to Almighty God, tho' there was no other ill in the Neglect, than only the horrible Rudeneſs and ill Manners that it diſcovers in us.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Secondly;</hi> The conſtant Exerciſe of <hi>Prayer</hi> is not only recommended to us under the notion of a very <hi>decent</hi> and <hi>reaſonable</hi> thing, but as an indiſpenſable <hi>Duty.</hi> God Almighty hath moſt ſtrictly charged it upon us, and we are Tranſgreſſors of his Laws if we do not practiſe it.</p>
               <p>Nature it ſelf ſpeaks ſufficiently plain in this matter. And where-ever God hath to the <hi>Law of Nature</hi> ſuper-added any <hi>Revelation</hi> of his <hi>Will,</hi> this Duty we are ſpeaking of fails not to make up a conſiderable part of it. It would be endleſs to mention all that is ſaid upon this Head by our Lord and his Apoſtles in the new Teſtament. I have told you al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready
<pb n="496" facs="tcp:63712:252"/>that they oblige us to no leſs than Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>always,</hi> Praying <hi>without ceaſing.</hi> They uſe likewiſe abundance of other Expreſſions to the like purpoſe. They bid us, <hi>every where to lift up holy hands. In every thing to make our Supplications known unto God. To pray in the Spirit with all Prayer and Supplication, and and to watch thereunto with all perſeverance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>If it be ſaid there is no ſuch expreſs com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for <hi>Prayer</hi> in that <hi>Revelation</hi> which was made to the <hi>Jews;</hi> I anſwer, It is a great Miſtake. The <hi>Prophets</hi> do over and over again injoin it as the Principal Part of the Worſhip of God. And thoſe that live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>Praying</hi> are by thoſe Inſpired Writers rank'd among the <hi>Atheiſts.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Pſalm. 53.1.4.</note> And as for the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Moſes</hi> it ſelf, it is obvious to obſerve, that the greateſt part of it is concerning <hi>Sacrifices.</hi> Now <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> if we will underſtand them right, were nothing elſe but that Form or Method of putting up <hi>Prayers</hi> to God, that was in thoſe times uſed in the World. So that, in truth, ſo far was <hi>Prayer</hi> from being left as a Matter of Indifferency to the <hi>Jews,</hi> that moſt of their Religion conſiſted in it.</p>
               <p>And accordingly all the Devout Men of that Church ſpent much of their Time in this Exerciſe. <hi>David</hi>'s manner was to pray ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven times a Day. And <hi>Daniel</hi> took himſelf to be ſo much obliged to the frequent Practice of this Duty; that rather than break his Cuſtom of performing his <hi>Solemn Devotions</hi>
                  <pb n="497" facs="tcp:63712:252"/>three times a day, he would expoſe himſelf to the Den of Lyons.</p>
               <p>Nay, <hi>Thirdly;</hi> So great is our obligation to frequent <hi>Prayer,</hi> that he acts againſt his <hi>Nature</hi> whoſoever doth not practiſe it. For, in truth, <hi>Prayer</hi> is the <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>peculiar</hi> Duty of Man, as he is a <hi>Man.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>That which conſtitutes the nature of <hi>Man,</hi> and doth <hi>formally</hi> difference, and diſtinguiſh him from all other <hi>Animals,</hi> is, not ſo much the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of <hi>Reaſon,</hi> as the capacity of being <hi>Religious.</hi> There are ſome Foot-ſteps of an obſcure <hi>Reaſon</hi> to be obſerved in many Creatures beſides <hi>Man;</hi> But in none, except <hi>Him,</hi> is there found any ſenſe of a <hi>Deity,</hi> or Diſpoſition towards <hi>Religion,</hi> or any thing that looks like it. That ſeems to be the Prerogative of Mankind. God endowed them, and them only with Spirits capable of Reflecting upon the Author of their Beings, and of making acknowledgments and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Religious Worſhip to him.</p>
               <p>So that to Worſhip God, to converſe with him in the exerciſe of Devotion, to Pray, and give Thanks for his Benefits, may be truly ſaid to be the proper Office of a Man as <hi>Man;</hi> The natural exerciſe of thoſe Faculties that diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh him from <hi>brute</hi> Creatures. And conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, thoſe that live in a continual neglect of this, what muſt be ſaid of them, but that they act unſuitably to their Natures, and are dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated into a ſort of <hi>Brutiſhneſs?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="498" facs="tcp:63712:253"/>
               <p>It appears then, that our <hi>Obligations</hi> to this Duty are many and great, and ſuch as there is no poſſibility of evading. But here is our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs, that thoſe Duties which we are moſt ſtrictly obliged to, are not thoſe that we are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways moſt inclined to practiſe. There may be ſomething in the moſt indiſpenſable Duties ſo <hi>harſh</hi> and <hi>unpleaſant;</hi> ſo diſagreeing with our other Appetites or Intereſts; They may be ſo <hi>hard</hi> to be performed; ſo <hi>Laborious,</hi> or ſo <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive,</hi> or upon ſome other account ſo <hi>ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full,</hi> that we ſhall naturally put our ſelves upon the finding out Excuſes for the ridding our hands of them, and eaſily ſatisfy our minds for ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
               <p>But now, which I deſire in the <hi>Fourth</hi> place to be conſidered, There are none of theſe preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to be made againſt this Duty of <hi>Prayer;</hi> none of theſe Inconveniencies do attend it. But it is ſo <hi>naturally,</hi> ſo <hi>eaſily</hi> performed; and ſo <hi>inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively</hi> to all our other <hi>Appetites</hi> and <hi>Intereſts;</hi> That one would think, nothing but mere lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, or ſtupidity, could hinder a Man from the daily Exerciſe of it.</p>
               <p>It requires no great <hi>Parts,</hi> or <hi>Learning,</hi> or <hi>Study</hi> for the diſcharging it. The meaneſt <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity,</hi> the moſt un-improved <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nderſtanding,</hi> if there be but an honeſt <hi>Heart,</hi> may perform it as well as the learnedeſt Man in the World.</p>
               <p>It requires no <hi>Labour</hi> or <hi>Toil.</hi> The feebleſt and moſt dis-ſpirited Body that can but lift up eyes to Heaven, and direct wiſhes thither, doth
<pb n="499" facs="tcp:63712:253"/>it as effectually, as the moſt vigorous Conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>It doth not go againſt the <hi>grain</hi> of any natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Inclination; nor put the body to any <hi>pain</hi> or <hi>hardſhip.</hi> Nor doth it contradict any appetite or affection that Nature hath implanted in us. No Humour, but either the <hi>Sottiſh</hi> or the <hi>Malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous;</hi> the <hi>Brutiſh</hi> or the <hi>Deviliſh</hi> is diſtaſted by it.</p>
               <p>It puts us to no <hi>Charge</hi> or <hi>Expence</hi> in the World, ſave that of our <hi>Thoughts;</hi> yet that is the nobleſt way of ſpending them: And if they be not employed thus, it is ten to one but they will be employed much worſe.</p>
               <p>It is not at all conſumptive of our <hi>Time.</hi> For we may attend this work, when we are a do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing other buſineſs; and there is no man ſo full of buſineſs, but he hath abundance of vacant ſpaces, which he will not know how to fill up to any good purpoſe, unleſs he hath learned this Art of ſaving Time.</p>
               <p>In a word, there is no Objection againſt it, it is one of the <hi>Eaſiest, Naturalest, Inoffenſivest</hi> Duties in the World; Nay, ſo <hi>eaſie</hi> it is, that the moſt Selfiſh Man, if he was to make his own Terms with God Almighty, could not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to obtain the Bleſſings he ſtands in need of, upon eaſier. If all the Mercies and Benefits we do daily and hourly need, and conſequently muſt expect and wiſh for; I ſay, if they be not worth asking at the Hands of God, or return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thanks for them after he has beſtowed them; they are worth nothing.</p>
               <pb n="500" facs="tcp:63712:254"/>
               <p>But beſides the <hi>unexceptionableneſs</hi> and <hi>eaſineſs</hi> of this Duty, it is alſo, in the <hi>Fifth</hi> place, the moſt <hi>pleaſant</hi> and <hi>delightfull</hi> Exerciſe in the World. It is true, <hi>vitious</hi> Men will not eaſily think ſo, but look upon it as a dry inſipid Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment; but ſo would the very <hi>Beatifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Viſion</hi> of God, and all the Exerciſes of Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified Souls in Heaven appear to ſuch Men. But they are not competent Judges of Matters of this Nature, having neither Experience of them, nor Diſpoſition towards them. Thoſe only can form right Notions of theſe ſpiritual Exerciſes, who have a good ſenſe and reliſh of God upon their Minds, and have uſed and accuſtomed themſelves to Devotion. Now to all ſuch I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal, whether the <hi>Delights,</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction,</hi> and <hi>Conſolation</hi> that they receive from converſing with God, and a hearty pouring out their Souls unto him, be not inexpreſſible? whether they do not find more <hi>Joy,</hi> and <hi>Peace,</hi> and <hi>Comfort</hi> in their attendance upon Gods ſervice, either in <hi>publick,</hi> or <hi>private,</hi> than ever they did from the Pleaſures and Gratifications of any of their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſenſes.</p>
               <p>So much as the <hi>Soul</hi> is more pure and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent than the <hi>Body;</hi> ſo much are the <hi>Pleaſures</hi> and <hi>Gratifications</hi> of that, more exquiſitely deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious than thoſe that ariſe from <hi>Corporeal</hi> Objects. But of all the Pleaſures of the Soul, thoſe that it receiveth from the Communications of God to it, in the Exerciſe of Devotion, are incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parably the higheſt, and moſt affecting. We
<pb n="501" facs="tcp:63712:254"/>may talk of <hi>Pleaſures</hi> and <hi>Enjoyments,</hi> but no man ever truly found them, till he became ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with God, and was made ſenſible of his Love, and partaker of his Spiritual Favours, and lived in an entire Friendſhip and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion with him; which Friendſhip and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munion is chiefly, if not only, both expreſſed, and maintained, by <hi>Prayer</hi> and other Exerciſes of Devotion.</p>
               <p>Add to this in the <hi>Sixth</hi> place, that Prayer is not only the moſt <hi>delightful</hi> Employment, but the moſt <hi>Creditable</hi> and <hi>Honourable</hi> that our Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are capable of. We account it, and ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry juſtly, a mighty Priviledge and Dignity to be known to Princes and great Men; To have their Ear, and to enjoy the Liberty of acceſs to them at all times: But what is this to the <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour</hi> and <hi>Dignity</hi> we receive, in having leave given us at all times, to approach into the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the King of the World?</p>
               <p>That we, poor ſinfull <hi>dust</hi> and <hi>aſhes,</hi> ſhould be permitted to ſpeak to ſo tranſcendent a Majeſty! Nay, ſhould have free Liberty given us to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe with him as with a Friend! To open all our wants, to acquaint him with all our concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to make known every thought of our Hearts, and every affair of our Lives to him! Nay, and to be aſſured that he will be ſo far from taking amiſs this boldneſs in us, that he will ſavourably accept all our Applications, and make as kind returns as we our ſelves can wiſh or deſire! What greater Honour are we capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:63712:255"/>of than this? O therefore, how far are they ſunk below all the <hi>Ambition</hi> of humane Nature, that will not take all opportunities of thus Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nouring and doing Credit to themſelves by the Exerciſe of Devotion!</p>
               <p>But ſo ſelfiſh are the Spirits and Tempers of many of us, that nothing will work upon them, but the conſideration of <hi>Gain,</hi> and <hi>Profit,</hi> and <hi>Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage:</hi> Let us ſee therefore what of this kind we may promiſe to our ſelves from <hi>Prayer,</hi> which is my <hi>Seventh</hi> and laſt conſideration.</p>
               <p>And let the point be put upon this Iſſue. Let all that has hitherto been ſaid for the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending of <hi>Prayer</hi> go for nothing. If it do not appear, that it is as <hi>profitable</hi> and <hi>gainful</hi> an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, as it is <hi>reaſonable</hi> and <hi>due;</hi> as it is <hi>eaſie</hi> and <hi>pleaſant,</hi> and <hi>honourable:</hi> Let no Man trouble himſelf about it, but throw off all thoughts of it for ever.</p>
               <p>But in this reſpect alſo the Motives to <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er</hi> are infinite. No Man can number the <hi>Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits</hi> and <hi>Advantages</hi> that do accrue to us from it. I can here but only touch upon a few of the many.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Prayer</hi> is the moſt proper means to <hi>ennoble,</hi> and <hi>refine,</hi> and <hi>ſpiritualize</hi> our Natures. Were it not for this, it would be impoſſible to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve our Souls aloft, in the midſt of ſuch a heap of earthly Rubbiſh with which they are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed. Our daily converſe with material objects would make us wholly <hi>ſenſual,</hi> and the <hi>Spirit</hi> would, in a manner, be loſt in the <hi>Fleſh.</hi> And ſo it doth really fare with all thoſe that
<pb n="503" facs="tcp:63712:255"/>live without Devotion towards God. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they may retain ſo much worldly prudence, as to enable them to govern their Temporal Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs to their Advantage; yet their Souls do per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly grovel upon the Earth. They are utterly devoid of the Spiritual Life. They have no more ſenſe of the Nobleſt and beſt things, which it is the perfection of their Faculties to be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed about; than a <hi>blind</hi> Man hath of <hi>Colours.</hi> Into this dull ſtate ſhall we all ſink, if we do not take care to maintain a conſtant Devotion to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God; for it is by That, that the ſenſe of Goodneſs is kept alive in us. It is That that raiſes us above this World, and preſerves our Minds from the Defilements of the Earth, which, by their continual mingling with material things, they would otherwiſe neceſſarily contract.</p>
               <p>But further, <hi>Prayer</hi> doth not only tend to the bettering the Conſtitution of our <hi>Minds;</hi> But the Benefits and good Influences of it do extend alſo to all the affairs and actions of our <hi>Lives.</hi> No body can tell, but he that hath tryed, how much devout and affectionate <hi>Prayer</hi> doth diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a Man to go about his buſineſs in the World. So far is this Exerciſe from hindring our Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, as is commonly pretended, that in truth it is a great furtherance to them.</p>
               <p>Beſides; It is the beſt Antidote in the World againſt all diſappointments and vexations that we can meet with; Againſt every ungratefull and diſpleaſing Accident that comes upon us in the courſe of our Lives. He that converſeth much
<pb n="504" facs="tcp:63712:256"/>with God, and uſeth to make all his concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments known to him, is prepared to bear all things patiently, and evenly, whatſoever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, nor can he light into any circumſtances of Life, which will not be, not only <hi>ſupportable</hi> to him, but <hi>eaſie</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p>Add to this in the laſt place, that it is <hi>Prayer</hi> that ſecures the Bleſſing of God, both upon our <hi>Perſons</hi> and upon our <hi>Labours;</hi> Upon our <hi>Baſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket</hi> and <hi>Store;</hi> Upon our <hi>Families;</hi> Upon our <hi>Employments;</hi> And upon all that we have, or do. So great is the Vertue of <hi>Prayer,</hi> that it turns all the Actions of our <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>civil</hi> Life, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever indifferent they be, into Actions of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</hi> And every thing that we have, or comes to us, is thereby made a <hi>Bleſſing</hi> of God, which without it perhaps might have been a <hi>Croſs</hi> and an <hi>Affliction.</hi> It is Prayer by which every <hi>Thing,</hi> and every <hi>Action</hi> is ſanctified to Believers.</p>
               <p>I might name ſeveral other Benefits and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages to be reap'd from the conſcientious Practice of this Duty; But thoſe that I have mention'd, may (I think) if they be conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, be ſufficient to recommend it to any Man whatſoever, that hath the leaſt Kindneſs for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: And therefore I will not burthen your Memories with heaping up more Motives. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly one thing I deſire leave to preſs a little more earneſtly, and particularly, than I have yet done, and that is, <hi>The Abſolute Neceſſity of Conſtant Prayer, in order to a Holy and Vertuous Life.</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="505" facs="tcp:63712:256"/>
               <p>Do any of you here preſent in good earneſt mean to <hi>live</hi> as you ſhould do? Do you really intend or deſire to endeavour after ſuch a Pitch of <hi>Vertue</hi> and <hi>Holineſs,</hi> as will be available for the ſaving your Souls everlaſtingly? If you do not, 'tis in vain to attempt the perſwading you to any thing of this Nature. If you do; then give me leave to tell you, that it is abſolutely neceſſary that you ſhould live in the conſtant Exerciſe of <hi>Prayer,</hi> otherwiſe you will never do your Buſineſs. And on the other ſide, I dare aſſure you, if you do thus practiſe, you will not fail of attaining the End you aim at.</p>
               <p>Theſe <hi>three</hi> things I dare lay down for Truth in this Matter:</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> It is impoſſible for any Man to be <hi>good,</hi> that lives without conſtant <hi>Praying.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> Whoever is <hi>good</hi> at the preſent, yet if he diſuſe himſelf in this Point, he will not continue good long.</p>
               <p>And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> Whoever makes a Conſcience of <hi>Praying</hi> frequently and heartily, and continues ſo to do, tho' he cannot at preſent be ſaid to be a <hi>good</hi> Man, yet it is impoſſible for him long to continue <hi>bad;</hi> he will certainly at laſt get the Victory over his Luſts and evil Habits. So that <hi>Prayer</hi> is both the <hi>Means</hi> without which Vertue cannot be attained; And the <hi>Means</hi> that never fails of attaining it; And the <hi>Security</hi> of it when it is attained. Of theſe <hi>three</hi> things very briefly, and I have done.</p>
               <pb n="506" facs="tcp:63712:257"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> I ſay, No Man can be a <hi>vertuous</hi> Man that lives without <hi>Praying.</hi> I do not deny, that ſome who make no great Conſcience of this Duty, but live in an habitual Neglect of it, may ſo far retain the Notions of <hi>good</hi> and <hi>evil,</hi> and thoſe Notions may to far influence their Actions, as that they ſhall not be <hi>notoriouſly</hi> and <hi>ſcandalouſly</hi> vicious. It may be they will not <hi>lie,</hi> nor <hi>cheat,</hi> nor <hi>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs</hi> any one. It may be they do not live in a Courſe of <hi>Lewdneſs</hi> and <hi>Debauchery;</hi> nor will be engag'd in any Deſign or Action that is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parently baſe or diſhonourable. But all this while, theſe Men are far from being <hi>vertuous</hi> in the Senſe we now ſpeak of. For we ſpeak of ſuch a <hi>Vertue</hi> as recommends us to God; ſuch a <hi>Vertue</hi> as will be effectual for our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in the other World. Now to ſuch a <hi>Vertue</hi> as this, there goes nothing leſs than an Univerſal Care over all our Actions; a Serious Endeavour to frame all our Converſation ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly and conformably to the Laws of our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. But how can any Man think he takes Care of this, that knowingly, and willingly, lives in a conſtant Contradiction to one of the principal Duties of our Saviour's Religion?</p>
               <p>Our whole Duty is made up but of <hi>Three</hi> Things; That a Man live <hi>ſoberly</hi> with reſpect to himſelf, <hi>righteouſly</hi> with reſpect to his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and <hi>piouſly</hi> with reſpect to God. Suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing now, that a Man take care of the <hi>two</hi> for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, that is, of doing his Duty to himſelf and his Neighbour, (which yet I believe never any
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:63712:257"/>Man did, that made no Conſcience of neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Prayers:) But ſuppoſe a Man could ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie himſelf as to theſe two Points of his Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; yet if he make no Conſcience of the <hi>third,</hi> that is, of <hi>Piety</hi> towards God, (as no Man can make Conſcience of that, who makes it no mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Conſcience whether he ſays his Prayers or no) in what Senſe or Notion can this Man be ſaid to have done his Duty, or to lead a ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous Life? Certainly in no Senſe at all. For as to one <hi>third</hi> part of his Duty, (which is indeed as conſiderable at leaſt, if not more, than either of the other) he is a notorious Tranſgreſſour. And tho' he be not <hi>unjust,</hi> tho' he be not <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched,</hi> yet wanting <hi>Piety</hi> towards God, he is <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious;</hi> And that will as certainly damn him, as either of the other. Either therefore one of theſe two things muſt be made appear, that is to ſay, that there may be <hi>Vertue,</hi> ſuch <hi>Vertue</hi> as will recommend us to God without <hi>Piety:</hi> Or that there may be <hi>Piety</hi> without ever <hi>Praying,</hi> or worſhipping God, (neither of which I believe will be eaſily affirmed;) Or it will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, That where there is no <hi>Praying,</hi> there is no <hi>Vertue,</hi> and conſequently no <hi>Salvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But beſides; We all know there is no Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of Living a Holy and Vertuous Life, (ſuch a Life as our Religion requires of us, and which alone will ſtand us in ſtead in the Day of Judgment) without the Grace of God, and the Aſſiſtances of his Holy Spirit. And we all know likewiſe that theſe are no way to be
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:63712:258"/>come by, but by earneſt, and affectionate, and conſtant <hi>Prayer.</hi> How therefore is it poſſible, that any Man, who is not very ſerious and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in the Exerciſe of Devotion, ſhould ever be able to live a Holy Life? He may indeed, by his own Study, and for his own Intereſt, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs himſelf of ſuch good Qualities, as may make a fair Shew in the World, and recommend him to all about him: But the inward Principle of Goodneſs and Holineſs he cannot have. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he doth not practiſe the Means of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of God, by which a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone that Principle is to be wrought in him.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Secondly,</hi> Let a Man at preſent be in a good State of Soul; yet it is impoſſible to preſerve himſelf in that State, without the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Exerciſe of Devotion. If a Man once begin to neglect his Prayers, or to grow more dull and remiſs in them, or more averſe to them, it is a certain Argument that he is in a declining Condition as to Vertue and Goodneſs. And as that <hi>Neglect,</hi> or that <hi>Dulneſs,</hi> or that <hi>Averſion</hi> increaſes, in the ſame Degree doth the Goodneſs of his Condition abate alſo. And when once it is come to that paſs with him, that the Flame of Devotion is quite extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his Heart; ſo that he can live, and enjoy himſelf without any Converſe or Intercourſe with God in Prayer; He may from that Period date the Loſs of his Spiritual Life. He is redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced to the State of a <hi>ſenſual, natural</hi> Man; <hi>Alive</hi>
                  <pb n="509" facs="tcp:63712:258"/>to the World, and to his Luſts, but perfectly <hi>dead</hi> to God.</p>
               <p>The plain <hi>Engliſh</hi> is, <hi>Prayer</hi> and Devotion is as neceſſary a Means to preſerve the Union be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Soul and God, in which our <hi>Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual</hi> Life conſiſts, as Meat and Drink is, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the Union between our Souls and Bodies, in which our <hi>natural</hi> Life conſiſts. And we may every whit as reaſonably expect to keep our <hi>Bodies</hi> alive without the conſtant and daily uſe of Eating and Drinking: As we can expect to keep our <hi>Souls</hi> alive to God without the conſtant and daily Exerciſe of Devotion.</p>
               <p>This may to ſome appear ſtrange Doctrine; But I do believe I may appeal to experience for the Truth of it. Nay, I dare put the Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion to any one, that ever took any ſerious Care of his Soul, and ſincerely endeavoured to live vertuouſly, and to pleaſe God, whether he hath not found the Matter to be ſo as I have repreſented.</p>
               <p>Have not ſuch always found, that ſo long as they kept up the Fervour and Vigour of their Devotion, ſo long as they were conſtant and diligent in their Prayers, and other Holy Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes: So long nothing could hurt them. So long they have always maintained their <hi>Post,</hi> and rather grown better than worſe. And though they have ſometimes been foully overtaken by ſome Sin that they reſolved againſt, yet that Relapſe hath done them no Miſchief. Their Continuance in their <hi>Prayers</hi> hath been an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote
<pb n="510" facs="tcp:63712:259"/>againſt the Malignity of the <hi>Sin;</hi> And they have preſently weather'd it out, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered no ill Conſequence by it; But it has ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther made them more watchful over them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and more careful of their Actions af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward.</p>
               <p>But, on the other ſide, have they not always found, that when once they began to abate of the Fervour of their Devotions; when once they began to <hi>pray ſeldomer,</hi> or with more Coldneſs and Indifference; They then began to live more looſely and careleſly; to be more dull and ſluggiſh towards every good Work? Till perhaps by degrees the true Senſe of God and Religion hath been in a great meaſure worn off from their Spirits, and they in a manner have returned to a Worldly and Senſual Life. Nay, have they not often found, that when it has been their Misfortune to break looſe from their Duty, and ſink for ſome time into a State of Careleſneſs and Forgetfulneſs of God, and of their own Vows and Reſolutions, (as it hath ſometimes hap'ned to very good Men:) I ſay, Have they not often found that this their going backwards in Goodneſs was occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned purely and ſolely by the Intermiſſion of their Devotions? That there was no viſible Reaſon, or Account to be given of this their Fall, but only that through Sluggiſhneſs, or ſome other Cauſe, they have neglected to pray to God ſo earneſtly and ſo frequently as they uſed to do? I am confident a great many can
<pb n="511" facs="tcp:63712:259"/>ſay this out of their own Experience. So that it concerns every Man that is at preſent in a good Diſpoſition of Mind, and hath good Hopes towards God; It concerns him as he loves his Soul; As he would not loſe all the Fruits of his paſt Labours and Endeavours in the Service of God; By all means poſſible to keep his Heart in a devout Frame: And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever comes of it not to grow cold or languid in his Prayers; Or to omit or diſuſe them, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in publick or private, upon any pretence whatſoever.</p>
               <p>But, <hi>Thirdly</hi> and <hi>Laſtly,</hi> to conclude all, there is this farther to be ſaid for the Encouragement of all ſorts of Perſons, to perſevere in the Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice of this Duty, namely; That whoever makes Conſcience of Saying his <hi>Prayers</hi> fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently and heartily, and continues ſo to do, tho' he be not <hi>good</hi> at the preſent, yet it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him long to continue <hi>bad.</hi> He will at laſt certainly get the Victory over all his Luſts and evil Habits, and attain to the Favour of God, and the Salvation of his own Soul. This neceſſarily follows from what hath been ſaid. A Courſe of <hi>Prayer</hi> and a Courſe of <hi>Sin</hi> cannot conſiſt together; One will neceſſarily deſtroy the other. <hi>Praying</hi> will either make a Man leave <hi>Sinning,</hi> (as a pious Man of our own uſed to ſay,) or <hi>Sinning</hi> will make a Man leave <hi>Praying.</hi> But this is to be underſtood of <hi>Prayer</hi> that is put up to God with great Seriouſneſs,
<pb n="512" facs="tcp:63712:260"/>and Heartineſs, and out of a Senſe of Duty and Conſcience. For as for thoſe <hi>formal</hi> Prayers that are made out of <hi>Cuſtom,</hi> or upon the account of <hi>Education,</hi> or for the ſerving ſome Worldly Ends of <hi>Interest,</hi> or <hi>Reputation,</hi> or the like; God reſpects them no more than the imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Tattle of Fools.</p>
               <p>All thoſe of us therefore that mean and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to be <hi>good,</hi> though we are not ſo already; Let us above all things take care to mind our Prayers. Let us <hi>pray</hi> to God in <hi>Private.</hi> Let us <hi>pray</hi> to God with our <hi>Families.</hi> And let us join as oft as we can with the <hi>Prayers</hi> of the <hi>Publick</hi> Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies. This I am ſure is the beſt Method we can take for the reforming our Lives, and for the gowing in all Vertue and Goodneſs. And the more we practiſe it, the better we ſhall like it. And if we perſevere therein we ſhall find the Comfort of it both in the <hi>Grace</hi> and <hi>Aſſiſtance</hi> we ſhall receive from the Holy Spirit, for the vanqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing all our Luſts and Corruptions; And in the <hi>Bleſſings</hi> we ſhall procure from God both to our <hi>Selves</hi> and our <hi>Families,</hi> and all our <hi>Affairs</hi> and <hi>Concernments;</hi> And, <hi>laſtly,</hi> in the <hi>Everlaſting Salvation</hi> of our Souls in the Day of the Lord Jeſus. <hi>To whom,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
